18 Editions of the Dewey Decimal Classifications
.A
Comaromi, J.P.
.W
   The present study is a history of the DEWEY Decimal
Classification.  The first edition of the DDC was published
in 1876, the eighteenth edition in 1971, and future editions
will continue to appear as needed.  In spite of the DDC's
long and healthy life, however, its full story has never
been told.  There have been biographies of Dewey
that briefly describe his system, but this is the first
attempt to provide a detailed history of the work that
more than any other has spurred the growth of
librarianship in this country and abroad.

Use Made of Technical Libraries
.A 
Slater, M.
.W
This report is an analysis of 6300 acts of use
in 104 technical libraries in the United Kingdom.
Library use is only one aspect of the wider pattern of
information use.  Information transfer in libraries is
restricted to the use of documents.  It takes no
account of documents used outside the library, still
less of information transferred orally from person
to person.  The library acts as a channel in only a
proportion of the situations in which information is
transferred.
Taking technical information transfer as a whole,
there is no doubt that this proportion is not the
major one.  There are users of technical information -
particularly in technology rather than science -
who visit libraries rarely if at all, relying on desk
collections of handbooks, current periodicals and personal
contact with their colleagues and with people in other
organizations.  Even regular library users also receive
information in other ways.

Two Kinds of Power
An Essay on Bibliographic Control
.A
Wilson, P.
.W
    The relationships between the organization and control of writings
and the organization and control of knowledge and information will
inevitably enter our story, for writings contain, along with much else, a
great deal of mankind's stock of knowledge and information.  Bibliographical
control is a form of power, and if knowledge itself is a form of power,
as the familiar slogan claims, bibliographical control is in a certain sense
power over power, power to obtain the knowledge recorded in written
form.  As writings are not simply, and not in any simple way, storehouses of
knowledge, we cannot satisfactorily discuss bibliographical control as
simply control over the knowledge and information contained in writings.

Systems Analysis of a University Library; 
final report and research project
.A
Buckland, M.K.
.W
    The establishment of nine new universities in the 1960's provoked a highly 
stimulating re-examination of the nature, purpose and management of academic
libraries.  Long-established attitudes and methods were questioned, but
although changes were made, the basic difficulty remained - a lack of objective
information about the best ways of providing a library service in a university.
The report of the UGC Committee on Libraries (the Parry Repot [267]), which,
in general, endorsed these changes, also stressed the need for research into
all aspects of academic library provision.

A Library Management Game:
a report on a research project
.A
Brophy, P.
.W
    Although the use of games in professional education has
become widespread only during the last decade, the method has
been used in a number of fields for many hundreds of years.
Its origins have been traced to simple war games, used in
military training when the "real thing" was either unavailable
or too dangerous.  In more recent times, these games have
become more and more sophisticated, and many now use large
electronic computers to handle the complex calculations involved.
Since 1956, when the first well-developed management game was
introduced, the technique has spread rapidly into a wide variety
of disciplines and today it is used at all levels of education,
from primary school classes to courses for experienced professional
men and women.  One of the main causes of this "game explosion"
has been the rapid development of sophisticated management
techniques, such as simulation and mathematical modelling, which
have been made possible by rapid advances in computer technology.

Abstracting Concepts and Methods
.A
Borko, H.
.W
     Graduate library school study of abstracting should be more than a 
how-to-do-it course.
It should include general material on the characteristcs and types of abstracts,
the historical development of abstracting publications, the abstract-publishing
industry (especially in the United States), and the need for standards in the
preparation and evaluation of the product.
These topics we call concepts.
     The text includes a methods section containing instructions for writing
various types of abstracts, and for editing and preparing abstracting publications.
These detailed instructions are supplemented by examples and exercises in the
appendix.
There is a brief discussion of indexing of abstract publications.
     Research on automation has been treated extensively in this work, for we
believe that the topic deserves greater emphasis than it has received in the
past.
Computer use is becoming increasingly important in all aspects of librarianship.
Much research effort has been expended on the preparation and evaluation of
computer-prepared abstracts and extracts.
Students, librarians, and abstractors will benefit from knowing about this
research and understanding how computer programs were researched to analyze text,
select key sentences, and prepare extracts and abstracts.
The benefits of this research are discussed.
    Abstracting is a key segment of the information industry.
Opportunities are available for both full-time professionals and part-time or
volunteer workers.
Many librarians find such activities pleasant and rewarding, for they know
they are contributing to the more effective use of stored information.
One chapter is devoted to career opportunities for abstractors.

Academic Library Buildings
A Guide to Architectural Issues and Solutions

This book attempts to present representative examples of successful
architectural solutions to the important problems librarians and
architects face in planning new college and university library
buildings or in remodeling and enlarging existing structures.  It does
not attempt to make case study evaluations, as was done by
Ellsworth Mason for Brown and Yale.  Nor does it present examples
of unsuccessful solutions except to show how to avoid mistakes,
and in these cases the libraries will not be identified.

The Academic Library Essays in Honor of Guy R. Lyle
.A
Farber, E.I.
.W
     As important for staff members' individual development
as was the apprenticeship in administration, perhaps the most
significant attitude one acquired while working for
Guy was engendered by his insistence that librarians must
be interested in and knowledgeable about the content of the
materials with which they dealt.  His love of literature, his
respect for scholarship, his admiration for good writing and
reading were manifested in many ways, but most notably in
his admonition that, though we were primarily a research
library, we must constantly keep in mind our obligation to
collect contemporary poetry, fiction and belles-letters.  It
was primarily up to the library staff, he felt, to be
responsible for these as well as for "general" books which crossed
disciplinary lines or fell between the disciplines, those books
which a faculty mostly concerned with research materials is
apt to overlook.  And in building this portion of the collection,
"there is no substitute for a thorough acquaintance with
books through a reading of critical reviews and the books
themselves."  This counsel is from The President, the Professor,
and the College Library, but the importance of its thrust--the
need to keep up with the world of books and publishing--was
continually impressed upon us.

Access to Libraries in College
.A
Hyman, R.T.
.W
     This study assumed that an additional use study held
less promise than an analytical consideration of concepts.
The basic approach was a survey comparing traditional and
current professional ideas on direct access.  Principal data-gathering
instruments were documentary analysis and opinion questionnaire.
     Findings of the documentary analysis included the following:
     Research from 1890 to 1970 on the direct shelf approach
and browsing left the problems largely unresolved and
evidently resistant to established methods of use and user
research.  The need for an exhaustive study of concepts was
confirmed.
     Open shelf libraries--organized through shelf classification
and relative location--were meant to arouse the intellectual,
social, and political interest of the average citizen and affect
his democratic self-realization.
     Definitions of "browsing" varied greatly: self-indulgence
by the untutored in objectionable works; beneficial self-education
for the general reader; valuable guidance for the scholar in his
research.

Access to Periodical Resources
.A
Palmour, V.E.
.W
          The purpose of this study was to develop, evaluate,
and recommend a national plan  for improving access to periodical
resources.  About 48 percent of all academic interlibrary loans
are for periodical materials, with the bulk of the loans being
satisfied in the form of photocopies.  A major consideration in
the long-range improvement of the interlibrary loan system is
the possible augmentation with a national system for acquiring,
storing, and satisfying loan requests for periodical materials.
          This study focused on the physical access to the
periodical literature.  Based on the needs of the library community,
design features were developed, and included the following:
          Service should be made available to all users
          without any restriction other than access
          through a library.
          Initially, the service should be confined primarily
          to rapid, dependable delivery of photocopies of
          journal articles.
          The collection of a center should be comprehensive
          in subject coverage excluding only medicine.
          All worthwhile journals should be collected
          irrespective of language.

The Acquisition of Library Materials

Ford, S.
.W
  The scope of acquisitions work, outlined in the Introduction,
acknowledges the importance of selection policy,
serials recording, and other topics kindred to acquisitions.
These topics are discussed in this book only as they relate
to obtaining library materials.  They are examined thoroughly
in books and papers that are cited in the references and the
bibliographic note.
  Centralized acquisitions and automation of order routines are of
major importance in order work and they are reviewed as chapters in
this book.  These chapters are introductions to the concepts and
problems of centralization and automation, not manuals of practice.
For treatment of these topics in particular and in depth the reader is
referred to the references cited.  For automation these references
are only a modest selection from an enormous literature.

Acquisition from the 3rd World
.A
Clarke, D.A.
.W
  The Ligue des bibliotheques europeennes de recherche (LIBER) was set up
in 1971 as an international non-governmental organization, with the aim of
establishing close collaboration between the general research libraries of
Western Europe, particularly national and university libraries, and in
particular to help in finding practical ways of improving the quality of
the services these libraries provide.
  At the second meeting of its General Assembly, held in Luxembourg in 1972,
LIBER decided to hold a seminar on the acquisition of materials from the
'Third World'; and I was charged with the 'intellectual organization' of this
seminar.  The purpose of the meeting would be to examine the problems of
acquisition; the availability of materials in European libraries both for
reference and for lending; and the feasibility of setting up a European centre
for the collection of such material, to be available for loan.  The provision
of bibliographic information, preferable in machine-readable form, was to be
a basic consideration, whatever means were proposed for acquiring publications
from those areas.  The Council of Europe made a generous grant towards the
cost of the seminar which was held at the University of Sussex from 17 to 19
September 1973.

The Administration of the College Library
.A
Lyle, G.R.
.W
  If this book has a central thesis, it rests upon the simple but
frequently neglected principle that college library service goes
beyond the commonly accepted functions of book circulation and
storage.  The college library exists, not merely to house and
circulate library materials, but to supplement and extend the teaching
process with reference service, to afford faculty members library
opportunities for improving instruction, and to encourage students
to read more and better books.  Administration is essentially a
service activity, a tool through which library functions are more
fully and efficiently realized.
  The present work retains most of the material of the first edition,
but includes substantial revision in each chapter.  The book was
planned not only as a text in the teaching of college library
administration but also for independent professional reading.  Because
readers have found the footnotes and chapter bibliographies useful
for reference purposes, they have been brought up to date and in
some cases extended.

technical communication networks in the two laboratories results from the 
interaction of both social relations and work structure.. The sociometric 
"stars" in the technical communication network who provide other members of the
organization with information either make greater use of individuals outside
the organization or read the literature more than other members of the 
laboratory..

Adopting the Library of Congress Classification System
.A
Matthis, R.E.
.W
     This manual is designed to make it possible for any library to change
efficiently to the Library of Congress Classification system.  Detailed
procedures are outlined which may serve as exact models or as a series of
suggested steps which have proven effective in actual use.  Most of the text
deals with the necessary criteria for effecting the planning, making the
preparations, selecting the tools, and establishing the procedures which
are essential for a reclassification project.  Beyond this, considerable
attention has been given to many of the problem areas of the LC
Classification-series, biography, bibliography, law, PZ3 and PZ4.  In
addition, the literature Tables VIIIa and IXa, two of the most
frequently used tables throughout the entire class system, have been
thoroughly explained and their application illustrated by a series of
comprehensive examples.  Since the mechanics, production, and cost of
catalogue card copy can significantly affect the flow of books to users,
a chapter has been devoted to describing the use of Xerox copying
machines in library operations.  Finally, an annotated bibliography
of books and articles judged to be helpful in deciding to reclassify is
included for those readers who wish to delve more deeply into the
tortuous and frustrating 50-year history of the concept of centralized
cataloging and classification.  The numbers enclosed in parentheses
throughout the text refer to sources in the bibliography which relate
to or support the arguments being advanced in any particular case.

Adventures in Librarianship
.A
Voigt, M.J.
.B
1970
.W
  There has long been a need for a continuing series to provide
scholarly reviews of the rapidly changing and advancing field of
librarianship, a series which would select subjects with particular
current significance to the profession and provide an analysis of
the advances made through research and practice.  Advances in
Librarianship is planned and designed to fill this need.  It will
present critical articles and surveys based on the published literature,
research in progress, and developments in libraries of all types.
   Mechanization may appear to be the most obvious of the advancing fronts
of librarianship, for automation has caught the enthusiastic support of all
librarians who can visualize its potential.
Advances in this field will certainly be found in every volume of this series.
As the first group of articles in this volume demonstrate, technological change
has an obvious and direct implication for libraries, but the problem has been
found to be much more complex than the simple inventory problem many experts
expected.
Advances in Librarianship is dedicated to presenting the realities of
automation, assessing where we are, where we are going, and how fast we can hope
to get there.
"The Machine and Cataloging" reviews the current status of the machine-produced
book catalog and what lies ahead as we enter the age of MARC.
Where business methods have greater applicability, progress is easier, as
reported in "Mechanization of Acquisition Processes."
Even in this area generally acceptable practices and standardization are in the
future, not the past.
One of the problems of major and immediate importance in computerization of
catalog information is that discussed in "Filing Systems for Computer
Manipulation."
This detailed review presents the complexity of the problems and suggests
possible solutions.
   For many years technical service costs have been defended without adequate
knowledge of the facts.
As automated procedures are proposed, standards are determining costs of
traditional operations become essential.
The article on standards for such costs shows why the problems have been difficult
and reviews the significant advances of the past few years.
   The school library has widened its dimensions in materials and services much
more rapidly than other libraries, as reflected in its new name, the
instructional media center.
Here, technical change, together with new teaching methods, has made possible
major developments in library service in schools as well as for children in
the public library.
Two articles make clear that what can be done has been demonstrated, and that
what remains is to make this the rule rather than the exception.
   Bibliotherapy is an example of a field in which progress has been slow.
   Articles which illustrate the potential which systems theory and managerial
planning theory have for libraries.
The articles on the application of these concepts, which come from research in
administration, are provocative and may appear controversial to some.
   The article on library development in developing countries provides an
analysis in depth of our efforts and degree of success in assisting other
countries in providing the library service which is so important in the modern
world.

Selective Dissemination of Information
.A
Mauerhoff, G.R.
.B
1974
.W
  The present contribution does not duplicate previous studies but
complements the earlier publications and closes the few gaps that
exist in the literature prior to 1966 and after 1971.  Additionally,
it is a bold attempt to evaluate critically and objectively the history
of the mechanized selective dissemination of information (SDI) as
reflected in the literature, from the initial description by Luhn
(1958, 1961b, c) to the post-1970 period when the SDI boom began losing
ground to the more popular on-line interactive systems.  The review
therefore questions and interprets the concept of SDI, its implementation,
and its evolution in the light of work performed by many companies,
government agencies, universities, societies, and libraries during the
last fourteen years.

Adventures in Theory of Languages
.A
Herdan, G.
.W
  In trying to give an account of the statistical properties of
language, one is faced with the problem of having to find the
common thread which would show the many and multifarious forms
of language statistics - embodied in scattered papers written
by linguists, philosophers, mathematicians, engineers, each using
his own professional idiom as belonging to one great whole:
quantitative linguistics.
  The book stresses the peculiarity of statistics of language
structure as against just conventional statistics.  To put the
difference between two types of statistics briefly, the latter comprises
the methods and parameters of general number statistics as applied, e.g., in
Economics and Demography, the former has its own methods and characterising
parameters, particularly useful for describing and evaluating language
structure.  The idea of statistical linguistics as using concepts and
methods of its own, which was adumbrated in the author's "Language as
choice and Chance", 1956, has now taken definite shape.
  Of this development I shall try to give a brief account.  In my book,
"Language as Choice and Chance", the foundation was laid for a truly
sensible application of statistics to language by my interpretation
of the langue-parole dichotomy as being essentially that between statistical
universe and sample.

The Age of Jewett: Charles Coffin Jewett and American Librarianship
1841-1868
.A
Harris, M.M.
.W
     Most librarians mark the beginning of modern librarianship
from the founding of the American Library Association in 1876 and
the appearance on the national library scene of such dynamic and
controversial figures as Melvil Dewey and Charles Ammi Cutter.
     But in doing so, they overlook an extremely significant era in
the history of our profession, for the quarter century preceding the
1876 meeting in Philadelphia was one characterized by great advances
in the field of American librarianship.  This period of growth was to
have considerable influence on the course of library development in
America after 1876.  To ignore the third quarter of the nineteenth
century is to risk misinterpreting the pivotal post-1876 era,
and in this time of reappraisal, it seems particularly appropriate
and useful to focus our attention on the years preceding the founding
of the American Library Association.

On Aggression
.A
Lorenz, K.
.W
  In this book, Lorenz deals with the evolution of aggression
in vertebrates.  He points out that aggressivity is totally different
from predation: that it is a biological necessity for defence of
territory and for a cornered animal, and that it becomes mixed
up with other innate drives, thus leading up towards reduction
of intraspecific damage. This, be it noted, is most evident in
fiercer social predators like wolves, where escape from the pack
is virtually impossible and where co-operation without fighting
is necessary for survival; whereas in the non-social but proverbially
peaceful dove prevention of escape leads to violent and often
fatal attacks on the weaker mate.
  In a final chapter he advances some suggestion as to how in
the human species, where evolution is primarily cultural, and
not guided by Darwinian selection in the strict sense, the
aggressive drive may be canalized into less dangerous channels.
Man has innumerable ways of adaptively ritualizing his behavior,
many of them analogous, if not homologous, to those found in
animals.  In any event, On Aggression is a fascinating book by
a master of his subject.

Education and Manpower for Librarians
.A
Asheim, L.E.
.W
  This paper is not an official policy statement
of the American Library Association nor
of the Office for Library Education.  It is
simply an exploration, an outline of possibilities
for consideration by the profession.  Its purpose is 
to generate discussion that will lead
eventually to a statement of Association policy
that the profession will support and make
effective.
  A basic assumption on which the statement
rests is this: that the library occupation is
much broader than that segment of it which is
the library profession, but that the professional
segment has responsibility for the definition
and supervision of the training and education
required by the complete range of activities
encompassed by the occupation.  Librarians
are not the only persons who work in
libraries, but librarians are the ones who are
concerned with the advancement and improvement
of the library profession.  It follows then
that it is the obligation of the professionals
to engage actively in the establishment and
maintenance of standards and norms governing
the preparation of people who work at
any level in libraries.  They should define and
guide the kinds of preparation most useful at
the pre-professional level and not
merely the education of those who will hold
positions at the level we now call "professional."

staff regarding the extent of the problem of
missing books.  The findings of this study gave
the Ohio State University libraries concrete
evidence as to how many books are missing
and indicated the areas in which book losses
are the greatest.  These figures also provide
information which can be conveyed to the
faculty or administration when they voice

Algebraic Systems
.A
Maltsev, A.I.
.W
   As far back as the 1920's, algebra had been accepted as the science
studying the properties of sets on which there is defined a particular
system of operations.  However up until the forties the overwhelming
majority of algebraists were investigating merely a few kinds of algebraic
structures.  These were primarily groups, rings and lattices.  The first
general theoretical work dealing with arbitrary sets with arbitrary
operations is due to G. Birkhoff (1935).  During these same years, A.
Tarski published an important paper in which he formulated the basic
principles of a theory of sets equipped with a system of relations.  Such
sets are now called models.  In contrast to algebra, model theory made
abundant use of the apparatus of mathematical logic.  The possibility of
making fruitful use of logic not only to study universal algebras but
also the more classical parts of algebra such as group theory was
discovered by the author in 1936.
  During the next twenty-five years, it gradually became clear that the
theory of universal algebras and model theory are very intimately
related despite a certain difference in the nature of their problems.  And
it is therefore meaningful to speak of a single theory of algebraic systems
dealing with sets on which there is defined a series of operations and
relations (algebraic systems). The formal apparatus of the theory is the
language of the so-called applied predicate calculus.  Thus the theory can
be considered to border on logic and algebra.

Indexing and Abstracting by Association

Doyle, L.B.
.W
This article discusses the possibility of exploiting the
statistics of word co-occurrence in text for purposes of
document retrieval. Co-occurrence is defined and related
to the mental processes of authors and readers; several
means of quantitative measurement of word co-occurrence
are then scrutinized.  It is shown that the most
strongly co-occurring word pairs, which are therefore
"associated" in a statistical sense, can be represented
in the form of an "association map."  The last half of the
article presents two modes of use of association maps
in literature searching.

Cost Analysis and Simulation Procedures for the Evaluation
of Large Information Systems
.A
Bourne, C.P.
Ford, D.F.
.W
A computer program has been written and used which
simulates the several-year operation of an information
system and computes estimates of the expected
operating costs as well as the amount of equipment
and personnel required during that time period.  The
program has been used for the analysis of several
large systems and has proven itself to be a useful
research tool for the study of systems with so many
components and interrelated operations that an
equivalent manual analysis would be extremely
cumbersome and time consuming,and perhaps even
impractical. This paper describes this program and
shows, as an example, some of the results of a simulation
of two of several suggested designs for a specific
information system.

A Note on the Pseudo-Mathematics of Relevance
.A
Taube, M.
.W
  Recently a number of articles, books, and reports
dealing with information systems, i.e., document retrieval
systems, have advanced the doctrine that such systems
are to be evaluated in terms of the degree or percentage
of relevancy they provide.
  Although there seems to be little agreement on what
relevance means, and some doubt that it is quantifiable,
there is, nevertheless, a growing agreement that a fixed
and formal relationship exists between the relevance and
the recall performance of any system.  Thus, we will find
in the literature both a frankly subjective notion of 
relevance as reported by individual users, and equations,
curves, and mathematical formulations which presumably provide
numerical measures of the recall and relevance
characteristics of information systems.  This phenomenon
of shifting back and forth from an admittedly subjective
and non-mathematical term to equations in which the
same term is given a mathematical value or a mathematical
definition has its ancient parallel in discussions
of probability.  One cannot, of course, legislate the
meaning of a term.  It all depends, as Alice pointed out,
on "who is master," the user or the term.  On the other hand,
the use of a single term in the same document to cover
two or more distinct meanings, especially when such a
usage is designed to secure the acceptance of a doctrine
by attributing to it mathematical validity which it does
not have, represents a more serious situation than merely
careless ambiguity.

Some Questions Concerning "Information Need"
.A
O'Connor, J.
.W
The expression "satisfying a requester's information
need" is often used, but its meaning is obscure.  The
literature on "information need" in relation to
retrieval suggests three different (though not inconsistent)
possible interpretations.  However, each of these
interpretations is itself fundamentally unclear. The
various obscurities involved are indicated by critical
questions, which those who write of information need
are invited to answer.

Vocabulary Building and Control Techniques
.A
Wall, Eugene
.W
   The rationale is given for creation and maintainance by an information 
center of a controlled indexing and retrieval vocabulary.. Basic vocabulary
principles are (1) use of natural language, (2) development of hospitality
to new concepts, (3) provision of adequate cross-referencing, and (4)
formatting for easy use.. Terminalogical conventions necessary for development
and control of a useful vocabulary are summarized, and the techniques for 
applying these conventions to construct a thesaurus are described.. 
Computerized editing techniques and updating techniques are briefly set forth..

Attendance and Use of the Science Library at M.I.T.
.A
Bush, G.C.
Galliher, H.P.
Morse, P.M.
.W
This is an interim report on continuing
studies of library operations at Massachusetts
Institute of Technology being made by
members of the Institute's Operations Research
Project in cooperation with the librarians and
library staff.  In this report, which is based
on actual observations of on-the-premise use
made of the Science Library, various statistics
measuring the kind, degree, and intensity of use
are tabulated.  In addition there are some
suggested measures of effectiveness of the library.
A unique outcome of the survey has been the
construction and verification of a mathematical
model employing probability theory to measure
rate and kind of use of library material
together with length of stay of library patrons.
Such models, characteristic of an operations
research approach, give promise of furthering
the goal of effective library management and
planning.

Information Gathering Patterns and Creativity
A study of research chemists in an industrial research laboratory
.A
Maizell, Robert E.
.W
   A comparison of creative and "noncreative" research chemists with 
respect to the ways in which they use their professional and technical 
literature.. The creative chemists differ from the "noncreative" in that the
former read more technical literature on the job, are less reluctant to use 
literature of greater reading difficulty, are less influenced in their 
independence of thought, read more extensively and consult more frequently the
older material, are more inquisitive and have broader cultural interests.. The
findings of the study are believed to be helpful in planning library and 
information services, in refining future inquiries into the ways in which
scientists use recorded information, and in improving tests for the 
identification of creative ability among chemists..

Keyword-In-Context Index for Technical Literature (KWIC Index)
.A
Luhn, H.P.
.W
   A distinction is made between bibliographical indexes for new and past
literature based on the willingness of the user to trade perfection for 
currency.. Indexes giving keywords in their context are proposed as suitable 
for disseminating new information.. These can be entirely machine-generated 
and hence kept up-to-date with the current literature.. A compatible coding 
scheme to identify the indexed documents is also proposed.. In it elements are
automatically extracted from the usual identifiers of the document so that the 
coded identifier yields a maximum of information while remaining susceptible 
to normal methods of ordering..

Savage, T.R.
.W
An experiment was conducted to determine which of 
four types of lexical indicators of content could be
utilized best by subjects to determine relevant from
irrelevant documents and to answer a set of 100
questions.  The results indicate that there were no
major differences between the groups using complete
text and abstracts to select relevant documents, but
the group utilizing the complete text obtained a
significantly higher score on the examination.

The World's Technical Journal Literature:
An Estimate of Volume, Origin, Language,
Field, Indexing, and Abstracting
.A 
Bourne, C.P.
.W
A quantitative estimate is made of the magnitude of the
world's scientific and technical journal literature problem.
Using a number of basic sources of statistical information,
a composite picture is established to show such things as
the total volume, linguistic and national origins, breakdown
by subject field, and degree of coverage by the abstracting
and indexing services.

Machinelike Indexing by People
.A
Montgomery, C.
Swanson, D.R.
.W
A study of several thousand entries in a classified bibliography
of article titles (the Index Medicus) revealed that a
large proportion of the title entries contained words identical
to or synonymous with words of the corresponding
subject heading.  It is inferred that a major part of the
bibliography studied could have been compiled by a machine
procedure operating on titles alone, provided the
machine was supplied with a suitable synonym dictionary.

Kessler, M.M.
.W
This report describes the results of automatic processing
of a large number of scientific papers according
to a rigorously defined criterion of coupling.  The
population of papers under study was ordered into 
groups that satisfy the stated criterion of interrelation.
An examination of the papers that constitute the
groups shows a high degree of logical correlation.

   Results of the census of the world's scientific and technical serial 
literature, within the limits defined and based on an examination of published 
source material from countries throughout the world, reflect a total title 
population much lower than estimated before.. Distribution of this population 
by country, showing better than 50% of the total divided among six major 
countries,  is included and discussed, together with a broad subject 
distribution of serials for certain countries..

New Factors in the Evaluation of Scientific Literature 
Through Citation Indexing
.A
Garfield, E.

Sher, I.H.
.W
   More than one million citations from the scientific literature have been 
processed by the Citation Index Project at the Institute for Scientific 
Information.. The Project, sponsored by NSF and NIH, will be described briefly,
and new methods of using citation data for evaluation of publications will be
discussed..
   Summaries of statistical data, compiled by computer methods such as the 
following, will be given..
   1. Frequency of citation of one journal by another..
   2. Frequency of current citations to the past literature..
   3. Frequency of self-citation by journals and authors..
   4. Number of source citations per cited paper..
   5. Number of references per source paper..
   6. Number of papers published per journal..

The Notion of Relevance
.A
Hillman, Donald J.
.W
   Analysis of the problems of defining the mutual relevancies of queries and 
document-collections indicates that they essentially involve the problem of
conceptual relatedness.. In order to consider the later problem, the question 
of concept-formation is first discussed, which in turn requires a definition of
concept.. An extensional interpretation is suggested whereby a concept is 
associated with a class of conceptually-similar documents.. Users' similarity-
judgments then provide the empirical data for formal definitions of concept and
conceptual relatedness.. It is found, however, that certain very general 
difficulties rule out the possibility of defining concepts and their 
relatedness by the method proposed.. Since this method is based on human 
relevance-judgments, it seems a natural one to adopt, so that its collapse has
serious practical and theoretical consequences.. An alternative approach is 
therefore proposed whose elaboration will form Part II of this article..

The Consistency of Human Judgments of Relevance
.A
Resnick, A.
.A
Savage, T.R.
.W
   A comparison of the ability of humans to consistently judge the relevance 
of documents to their general interests from bases of citations, abstracts, 
keywords, and total text was made under controlled experimental conditions.. 
The results showed that 1) humans are able to make such judgments consistently,
and 2) the consistency of the judgment is independent of the particular base 
from which it is made.. Apparent inconsistency arising from judgments made on the 
basis of abstracts remains unexplained.. This experiment, as well as others
concerned with human evaluations of text material, leave unexplored the basic
problem of providing a metric scale on which such evaluations can be measured..

The Distribution of Term Usage in Manipulative Indexes
.A
Houston, Nona
.A
Wall, Eugene
.W
   A semi-empirical correlation, based on data from nine indexes, permits the
prediction of the percentage of terms in a manipulative index vocabulary which 
will be used to index any given number of documents.. This is a function of the
total number of index entries in the system.. A log-normal relationship, 
similar  to Zipf's Law, exists between total index entries and distribution of
term usage.. Based upon the correlation, optimum vocabulary size and growth rate
can inferred, as well as the most efficient arrangement of index entries in a 
storage medium.. The results agree well with published data and appear to be 
particularly useful for designers of mechanized retrieval or publication
operations..

Measuring the Reliability of Subject Classification by Men and Machines
.A
Borko, Harold
.W
   Procedures for measuring the consistency of document classification are 
described.. Three subject specialists classified 997 abstracts of psychological 
reports into one of eleven categories.. These abstracts were also mechanically
classified by a computer program using a factor score computational procedure.. 
Each abstract was scored for all categories and assigned to the one with the
highest score.. The three manual classifications were compared with each other
and with the mechanical classifications, and a series of contingency 
coefficients was computed.. The average reliability of manual classification 
procedures was equal to .870.. The correlation between automatic and manual 
classification was .766..

A Quantitative Measure of User Circulation Requirements and Its Possible
Effect on Stack Thinning and Multiple Copy Determination
.A
Trueswell, Richard W.
.W
   The strategy outlined in this article describes a possible aid to the 
librarian for thinning a library's stack according to the criterion of user 
needs.. The method uses the last circulation date as a parameter of user 
circulation requirements.. The resulting stack collection would, by design,
satisfy over 99 percent of the user circulation requirements and yet be of
minimum size.. Preliminary, but not yet fully validated research, indicates 
that the number of volumes in a library's holdings may be reduced by 60 to 70 
percent and yet satisfy well over 99 percent of the user requirements.. It may
also be possible to determine which books should have multiple copies in order
that user disappointment can be minimized.. The effective result of this 
approach is that there now may be a quantitative method of maintaining the 
library's holdings at a reasonable level and, in addition, a reduction in the 
disappointment of the user who is unable to find the book he wants because of 
use by another..

Improvement of the Selectivity of Citation Indexes to Science Literature
Through Inclusion of Citation Relationship Indicators
.A
Lipetz, Ben-Ami
.W
   Citation indexes to large bodies of science literature can often list far
more citing references under the known cited reference than the user can 
afford the time to look up.. By providing some additional information, beyond 
the minimal association of the citing reference with the cited reference, a 
citation index could provide the means of the user to select from a long list 
those citing references which are most relevant to his immediate search 
requirement.. Means of providing this selectivity are discussed.. Particular 
attention is given to the possibility of adding short codes to the citation 
entries which would be informative of the way in which the citing publication
is operationally related to the cited one (this method is an integral feature 
of the Shepard's legal citations).. A scheme of citation relationships of 
potential value to users of science literature is presented.. These 
relationships were tested on a sampling of physics literature.. The suggested 
categories include indicators of the relation of the citing reference to the
scientific process in general, as well as indicators of its relationship to the
cited reference in particular.. Assignment of the categories to a citation 
requires the exercise of judgment, as in subject indexing, but does not involve
the use of subject terminology.. An illustration is provided of the application 
from a citation index to physics literature..

The Norms of Citation Behavior: Prolegomena to the Footnote
.A
Kaplan, Norman
.W
   The publication explosion has focused renewed attention on the lowly 
footnote.. While we are all at least partially aware of the technical functions
of the citation for both the writer and the reader of the scientific paper, 
little is known about the norms operating in actual practice.. Even less is 
known about the operating norms with respect to the more sociological functions,
including the acknowledgement of intellectual debts or the conferral of 
recognition upon the works of others.. This paper reviews the state of our 
knowledge, raises questions, and proposes suggestions and hypotheses for 
studying the relationships between footnoting practices among scientists and
the social system of science..

Adaptive Information Dissemination
.A
Sage, C.R.
.A
Anderson, R.R.
.A
Fitzwater, D.R.
.W
   Computer dissemination of information offers significant advantages over
manual dissemination because the computer can use strategies that are 
impractical and in some cases impossible for a human.. This paper describes
the Ames Laboratory Selective Dissemination of Information system with emphasis
on the effectiveness of user feedback.. The system will accept any document, 
abstract, keyword, etc., in a KWIC or Science Citation Index Source format..
User profiles consist of words or word clusters each with an initially 
assigned significance value.. These values are used in making the decision to
notify a user that he may be interested in a particular document.. According to
responses, the significance values are increased or decreased and quickly 
attain an equilibrium which accurately describes the user's interests.. The
system is economical compared to other existing SDI systems and human
intervention is negligible except for adding and deleting profile entries..

An Experiment in Automatic Indexing
.A
Damerau, Fred J.
.W
   This report describes a method of indexing documents which is based on the 
assumptions, (1) that a subset of the words in a document can be an effective 
index to that document, and (2) that this subject can be approximated by 
selecting those words from the document whose frequencies are statistically
unexpectedly high.. The results of the experiment are encouraging, although not
definitive because any index set chosen must be tested by using it for 
retrieval from a large collection..

Comparative Indexing: Terms Supplied by Biomedical 
Authors and by Document Titles
.A
Schultz, Claire K.
.A
Schultz, Wallace L.
.A
Orr, Richard H.
.W
   The original aim of this study was to obtain objective data bearing on the 
much argued question of whether author indexing is "good".. Author indexing of
285 documents reporting biomedical research was scored by comparing the author-
supplied terms (author set) for each paper with a criterion set of terms that 
was  established by asking a group of 12 potential users to describe the same
document.. Terms in the document title (title set) were scored similarly.. The
average author set contained almost half of all the terms employed by more than 
one member of the user group and scored 73% of the maximal possible score, as 
compared with 44% for the average title set.. When judged by the method and 
criterion employed here, author indexing is substantially better than indexing 
derived from document titles.. The findings suggest that indicia supplied by an
author should serve scientists in biomedical disciplines other than his own 
about as well as they serve his disciplinary colleagues.. The general method
developed for measuring indexing quality may represent a practical yardstick of 
wide applicability..

.W
   This paper defines and describes the KWIC (keyword in context) index concept,
providing a history of the concept and of its literature.. It discusses 
variations of the index, such as the Bell Telephone Index, KWOC indexes, and 
the WADEX..
   The paper discusses improvements and variations to the KWIC index, such as 
manipulation of the index line, variations of the code, addition of 
classification information, combination of author index and title index, and 
improvements to the preparation of the KWIC indexes, such as improvement of 
titles and use of a thesaurus, and discusses improvement of the use of the KWIC 
index.. The paper discusses the usage of the KWIC index and comments on the 
future of KWIC indexes of the KWIC concept..

   A function was developed for the optimum distribution of indexing terms by 
the number of postings.. This makes it possible to transmit information with 
maximum efficiency.. The comparison of the actual distribution of the term 
groups with the calculated optimum distribution provides an objective measure 
for evaluating any indexing system with respect to its efficiency as 
information transmission channel..

Relevance Disagreements and Unclear Request Forms
.A
O'Connor, John
.W
   Disagreements about the relevance of documents to retrieval requests occur
because relevance judges differently interpret requests of documents.. Requests
may be differently interpreted because they are unclear.. Well-known types of
request obscurity are reviewed.. Less well known is that a request may be 
unclear because its form - "documents about subject S", "document answering 
question Q", etc. - is unclear.. 
   Explications are developed of the meanings of the request forms just given 
and several others.. A request of any of the forms discussed is interpreted to 
be for documents which support statements of a specified kind in a specified 
way.. Examples are given which suggest that some, perhaps all, "about S" 
requests are unclear.. Some ways of formulating clear question requests are 
given..
   Various ways in which documents may support statements are distinguished..
These depend on on such factors as parts of a document use, inference strength,
and background knowledge permitted.. Some possible clear support specifications
are indicated..

   Although a large number of Selective Dissemination of Information (SDI) 
Systems have been planned, implemented, and tested over the past few years, 
insufficient attention has been given to the collection and interpretation of 
important data needed for evaluation.. We describe some of the defects common 
to almost all of the reported systems, single out one recent report for 
detailed discussion and argue in favor of collection and correct interpretation 
of data on one important and frequently overlooked evaluation factor..

as precision and recall, that have been suggested by other workers.. The new 
measure is based on calculations of the expected number of irrelevant documents
in the collection which would have to be searched through before the desired 
number of relevant documents could be found.. Its advantages are: (1) it 
provides  a single index of the property it attempts to measure; (2) it allows
for gradations of retrieval status, through the mathematical concept of a "weak 
ordering"; (3) it evaluates retrieval performance relative to random searching;
and (4) it takes into account the amount of relevant material desired by the 
requester..

A Literature Search and File Organization Model
.A
Leimkuhler, Ferdinand F.
.W
   A principle of sequential optimization in search theory distributes the 
search effort at each stage so as to maximize the probability of target 
detection with the effort expended thus far.. As an application of this 
principle to the search of pertinent items in a literature file, the file items
should be arranged in decreasing order of the probability that an item will 
yield the information sought.. Complete ordering in this manner may not be
feasible, and it is proposed that the files be partially ordered in search 
zones with some loss in search efficiency.. A model for assessing the relative
efficiency for partial ordering is developed and used to determine optimal zone 
sizes under an assumed target distribution pattern.. In this way, trade-off
between file organization effort and search effort can be meaningfully 
evaluated.. A representative target distribution function for search literature 
appears to follow the Bradford law of scattering.. This function is used to 
demonstrate the application of the model over a meaningful range of parameters 
obtained from empirical studies.. It is shown that a good two-zone search plan
to scientific literature is one in which 15-20% of the most useful documents 
are examined first.. Only about one of three searches should have to go on to a 
search over the remainder of the file..

The Publication Inflation
.A
London, Gertrude
.W
   The much-vaunted information explosion seems to be the manifestation of a 
rather generalized publication inflation.. Multipublication and pretentious
writing have become obstacles to "communication between human minds". To 
counteract their harmful effects it will be necessary to reduce the quantity 
and improve the quality of the printed records by filtering the material before 
it is stored for retrieval..

A Computer-Based Serials Control System for a Large Biomedical Library
.A
Roper, Fred W.
.W
   Rather than reiterate the obvious purposes and procedures involved in 
creating a computer system for control of serials, in this paper the author
deals with the concept upon which the UCLA system is based and the manner in
which the system is maintained in day-to-day operations of the UCLA Biomedical
Library.. The paper deals with some of the points made in an earlier publication
from the UCLA serials project.. The attempt is to show how the theory of 
publication pattern (discussed in the earlier article) has been used to 
produce a different idea in computer control of serials.. Publication pattern 
information which is entered into the master record for each title causes
check-in cards for the next expected issue of each title to be generated by the
computer, regardless of when this text issue is expected - next week, next
month, next year.. This is departure from most systems, which attempt to 
predict a certain number of issues which should arrive during a given time 
period.. The information, which must be a part of the computer record, is 
described, as are library procedures in maintaining the system..

A Study of Searching the Eye Research Literature
.A
Miller, Russell R.
.W
   The paper is a report of most of the major findings of a study in searching
the periodical eye research literature.. Questions were collected from eye 
researchers and a selected group of these were searched in nine different 
secondary sources.. Articles thought to be relevant were Xeroxed and sent to 
the eye researchers who subsequently rated the articles.. Articles of eye
research interest are found in a wide variety of journals, but a small number
of journals carry a large proportion of the articles judged valuable by the eye
researchers.. Approximately a fourth of eye research articles are in foreign 
languages.. Translations are not readily available.. Despite a delay of more 
than 15 month between the original appearance of article in journals and the 
mailing of photocopies, about half of the articles of interest to the 
researchers were not known to them previously.. For extensive retrospective
searches more than one secondary service must be used.. Index Medicus and 
Excerpta Medica (Section 12) or Ophthalmic Literature would be good sources..
MEDLARS demand searches were not shown to be clearly superior to manual 
searches of Index Medicus.. Titles, abstracts, and full text were shown to be
equally effective in permitting searches to retrieve references that were
subsequently rated as relevant by the researchers.. A searcher with a background
in ophthalmology was able to retrieve more articles of research interest than 
other non-ophthalmologist searchers..

Psychology and Information
.A
Miller, George A.
.W
   An aspect of the human use of information that has generally been overlooked 
in the automation in information services is the human tendency to locate 
information spatially.. Computer-based systems do not necessarily assign any 
unique role to spatial tags, and so a feature of considerable importance for 
the organization of the user's memory seems to have been largely overlooked..
The spatial dimension of human memory is discussed, and some suggestions are 
offered for exploiting it more effectively in the context of information 
retrieval services..

The Use of Simulation in Studying Information Storage and Retrieval Systems
.A
Baker, Norman R.
.A
Nance, Richard E.
.W
   Previous applications of simulation to information storage and retrieval 
systems (ISRS) have been overly restrictive in their scope and have failed to
consider the environment within which such systems operate.. This paper 
considers the ISRS as a subsystem within a larger system which includes the 
users and the funders of the retrieval system.. The three components form a 
closed-loop information feedback system in which user response influences both 
the funding and operation of the ISRS as it attempts to satisfy user needs 
within a finite budget allocation.. Reward-cost theory provides the basis for
describing user behavior.. An industrial dynamics model has been developed to 
simulate ISRS/user/funder behavior where a university departmental library is 
the ISRS component.. The results which such an analysis can produce are 
discussed..

Retrieval of Answer-Providing Documents
.A
O'Connor, John
.W
   (I) Better understanding of subject document retrieval might result if 
different functions of subject document retrieval system are studied 
separately.. This paper is concerned with retrieval of documents, in response 
to a question, from which answers to that question can be inferred 
("answer-providing documents").. "Answer can be inferred from document" has 
many possible meanings, one of which must be selected (an "inference 
specification").. Inasmuch as scientists in a field disagree about the 
correctness of inferences, have somewhat different background knowledge, etc., 
any inference specification can only approximate scientific inference 
practices.. Two sources of systematic knowledge of document-statement inference 
practices in a scientific field are described.. (II) If a content word occurs 
in a question, then it occurs in any answer to that question (with some 
apparently tractable exceptions).. An indexing procedure based on that fact is
described which would permit retrieval of all answer-providing documents for a 
question.. However, because the indexing is "nonrelational", it could cause 
false retrievals as well.. Various ways of dealing with such false retrievals 
are   briefly indicated, and a study is sketched that would provide data for 
helping selection among them.. Two special point concerning indexing for 
retrieval of answer-providing documents are discussed separately..

On Understanding User Choices: Textual Correlates of Relevance Judgements
.A
Gifford, Carolyn
.A
Baumanis, George J.
.W
   An empirical investigation of the role of documents in relevance judgements
is reported.. Abstracts previously judged relevant, partially relevant, and 
nonrelevant to each of 61 questions were compared to see whether textual 
differences could be found which might reasonably account for the rating 
differences.. The results of this comparison were fairly clear-cut 
characterizations in each case of relevant and partially relevant abstracts.. 
These characterizations were found to be expressible largely as meaningful
co-occurrences of terms closely related to the question.. It is suggested that 
the textual bases of user choices may be more understandable than has been 
supposed..

Word-Word Associations in Document Retrieval Systems
.A
Lesk, M. E.
.W
   The SMART automatic document retrieval system is used to study association 
procedures for automatic content analysis.. The effect of word frequency and 
other parameters on the association process is investigated through examination
of related pairs and through retrieval experiments.. Associated pairs of words
usually reflect localized word meanings, and true synonyms cannot readily be
found from first or second order relationships in our document collections.. 
There is little overlap between word relationships found through associations 
and those used in thesaurus construction, and the effects of word associations 
and a thesaurus in retrieval are independent.. The use of associations in 
retrieval experiments improves not only recall, by permitting new matches 
between requests and documents, but also precision, by reinforcing existing 
matches.. In our experiments, the precision effect is responsible for most of 
the improvement possible with associations.. A properly constructed thesaurus,
however, offers better performance than statistical association methods..

Effectiveness of Information Retrieval Methods
.A
Swets, John
.W
   Results of some 50 different retrieval methods applied in three experimental 
retrieval systems were subjected to the analysis suggested by statistical 
decision theory.. The analysis validates a previously-proposed measure of
effectiveness and demonstrates its several desirable properties.. The 
examination of a wide range of data in relation to this one metric provides a 
clear and general assessment of the current state of the retrieval art..

Managerial Cost Accounting for a Technical Information Center
.A
Helmkamp, John G.
.W
   The purpose of this paper is to describe a research project conducted at a 
technical center to test the hypothesis that: A theoretically-sound managerial 
cost-accounting system can be designed to meet the specific characteristics of 
a technical information center by revising and innovating systems utilized by 
other enterprises.. A computerized cost system was developed and operated for
a three-month period to test this hypothesis.. The results of the study 
indicate that effective managerial cost accounting is possible for a technical
information center.. Relevant cost information was generated periodically to 
measure the operating performance of the center's production process.. A 
summary of the data that were reported regularly to management is presented 
in this paper..

Leith, John D. Jr.

   The author's journal reference cards for 1965 and 1966 were analyzed 
according to three "interest patterns": (I) the total collection of 1469 
article titles, a "potentially useful" set; (II) a subset concerning only his
research speciality; and (III) a subset of articles defined as "useful". For
each pattern, journals were ranked by frequency of use and a scatter diagram 
was drawn..
   Patterns I and II largely resembled patterns obtained by counting citations
in basic journals or by counting publications of selected researchers.. Pattern 
III was more widely scattered..  It is concluded that access to diverse 
journals is needed by researchers to supply new ideas, and that this diversity 
of reading is not reflected adequately by citation counting or other indirect 
means..
   Current Contents, used by the author for current-awareness purposes in 
building his card file, generated 88% of all articles.. Scatter diagrams 
indicated the decreased scatter predicted from its use..
   The 30% most important journals in this collection, including about 80% of
titles, are ranked for each pattern..

The Effectiveness of Automatically Generated Weights and 
 Links in Mechanical Indexing
.A
Artandi, Susan
.A
Wolf, Edward H.
.W
   Work concerned with the statistical evaluation of the output of the MEDICO 
automatic indexing method is described.. The statistical test were designed
primarily to examine the validity of the assumptions which formed the basis of 
the algorithms developed for the automatic computation of weights and for the 
automatic generation of links between index terms and modifiers.. This 
evaluation also includes a comparison of the output generated from full text 
and from the processing of the abstracts or summaries of the same articles..

On-Line Access to Information: NSF as an Aid to the Indexer/Cataloger
.A
Bennet, John L.
.W
   When adding a document to a collection, an indexer should choose a 
representation which makes evident both the content of the document and its 
relation to other documents already in the collection.. Toward this end, the 
Negotiated Search Facility (NSF) makes possible indexer-controlled retrieval of 
information from a collection data base using tools beyond those available in a
traditional bibliographic catalog.. The design philosophy of NSF is to offer a 
framework to guide the indexer while allowing him freedom to retrieve any data 
which he judges will help him make indexing decisions.. An example which 
indicates how an indexer might use the facility also shows how the display
formats and command language promote interaction.. While the discussion is 
directed toward indexing, it should be clear that the facility would be equally
useful to the searcher..

Computer Selection of Keywords Using Word-Frequency Analysis
.A
Carroll, John M.
.A
Roeloffs, Robert
.W
   A statistically based method for automatically identifying keywords in 
machine-readable text has been developed which produces keyword lists that 
agree better with composite lists produced by panels of human indexers than do 
lists produced by five statistical criteria previously suggested, and also 
better than lists produced by most of the individual panel members.. The method
makes use of both the in-document word-occurrence frequency and the in-corpus
relative occurrence frequency as measures of word importance.. Each statistical
criterion was compared with the performance of human indexers by the use of rank
correlation statistics.. The simple word count was found to be superior to the
other four previously suggested criteria - all of which made use of the 
in-corpus relative occurrence frequency.. The test were conducted over 19
documents dealing with the subject of Information Science, a total of over 
66,000 word occurrences.. Seventeen indexers representing eight different 
information centers participated in experiments..

A Graphic Catalog Card Index
.A
Lewis, Elizabeth M.
.W
   To improve accessibility and maintenance of art slides in the United States
Military Academy Library at West Point, a model card with a graphic image of 
the slide was designed with pertinent identifying information displayed 
directly above a black-and-white opaque photo and also key-punched into it.. 
The card serves for ample comparison reference previous to handling the slides
and can produce a subject-arranged permuted index in book form.. The later 
permits access from the approach of form, geographic area, name, time of 
origin, artist, school, or style, etc.. Some added advantages, common to other 
kinds of graphic collections, are detailed.. Estimated costs of 
photo-reproduction of original cards, various kinds of copies, and computer 
time and materials are listed.. Future benefits from a consistent, unified 
cataloging system for graphic objects and the dissemination of this kind of 
information in a network structure are indicated as major goals..

Indexing Consistency and Quality
.A
Zunde, Pranas
.A
Dexter, Margaret E.
.W
   A measure of indexing consistency is developed based on the concept of 
"fuzzy-sets".. It assigns a higher consistency value if indexers agree on the 
more important terms.. Measures of the quality of an indexer's work and 
exhaustivity of indexing are also proposed.. Experimental data on indexing 
consistency is presented for certain categories of indexers; and consistency,
quality, and exhaustivity values are compared and analyzed.. The analysis of 
indexing exhaustivity leads to the conclusion that the increase of information
as a result of group indexing is a process analogous to Bradford's law of
information scattering, Lotka's law of scientific productivity, and Zipf's law
of vocabulary distribution..

Is Interindexer Consistency A Hobgoblin?
.A
Cooper, William S.
.W
   It is often assumed that the amount of interindexer consistency experienced 
under a given method of indexing is somehow indicative of the quality of the 
indexing.. To explore this assumption, two hypotheses are stated concerning the 
possible connection between interindexer consistency and indexing quality.. A
specific counter-example is then exhibited which shows both hypotheses to be
invalid.. Although a mathematical analysis of the counterexample yields certain
insights, the general relationship between interindexer consistency and 
successful retrieval is more subtle than might have been expected.. It is
concluded that until equations describing this relationship have been derived, 
measurements of inter-indexer consistency will have little meaning as clues to
indexing quality..

The Cost Analysis of Document Surrogation:  A Literature Review
.A
Landau, Herbert B.
.W
   A state-of-the art literature review on the cost of classification, 
cataloging, indexing, and abstracting has been included.. It was found that
while some data on specific costs are available, the literature is generally
found lacking from the point of view of accuracy, completeness, consistency,
and availability..

Some Independent Agreements and Resolved Disagreements 
   About Answer-Providing Documents
.A
O'Connor, John
.W
   Eighty-two documents and 30 questions, in documentation and related areas, 
was compared to find answer-providing documents (documents from which answers to 
questions can be inferred).. Two judges (documentation experts) made 
comparisons independently.. They discussed their disagreements, attempting to
resolve them.. In each case the positive judge was first asked to indicate what
answer he inferred, and from what document passage(s).. The further discussion
depended on the details of each case.. In general, the resolution procedures 
used will resolve a disagreement about whether a document is answer-providing
or reduce it to a familiar kind of scientific disagreement (about a passage's
meaning, a statement's correctness, or an inference's correctness).. This seems
better than treating relevance judgements as subjective and not open to 
rational discussion..

Information Science: Toward the Development of a True Scientific Discipline
.A
Yovits, M. C.
.W
   It is pointed out that if information science is to be considered a "true" 
science similar to physics or chemistry then it must have a set of concepts and
analytical expression which apply to the flow of information in a general way..
In several previous papers, the author and a colleague have described a model 
of a generalized information system which has  wide, and perhaps universal 
applicability.. This paper elaborates on this model and indicates the range of 
its applicability.. Several fundamental quantities are defined specifically in 
a way which allows for quantification.. It is pointed out in this paper that 
this model can be the basis for the development of a "true" science of 
information with all of the necessary requirements for a science.. By the use 
of this model and the definition of a "true" science, the goals and requirements 
for a curriculum in information science are thus established.. Within this 
context, information is defined as data of value in decision making.. 
Quantitative measures of information can be obtained by relating information to 
specific observable actions which can be measured physically..

A Comparison of a Keyword from Title Index with a Single Access Point 
 per Document Alphabetic Subject Index
.A
Jahoda, G.

Stursa, Mary Lou
.W
   Two indexes to a collection of 3,204 documents in the field of chemistry 
were  test-searched.. The indexes are a keyword from title index without added
keywords and a single access point per document alphabetic subject index.. The
indexes were searched by 13 graduate chemistry students using 55 questions..
Search results are characterized in terms of recall, precision, and search 
time.. There is no statistically significant difference in recall and precision
search result between the multiple access points per document keyword from 
title index and the single access point per document alphabetic subject index..
Search time was significantly better for the alphabetic subject index for all 
but those questions having only one relevant document..

Patterns of Name Ordering among Authors of Scientific Papers:
A study of Social Symbolism and Its Ambiguity
.A
Zuckerman, Harriet A.
.W
   With increasing scientific collaboration, visibility of individual 
role-performance has diminished.. Ordering of author' names as an adaptive 
device which symbolizes their relative contributions to research.. Interviews 
with Nobel laureates and comparisons of their name-order practices to those of 
other scientists suggest that this symbol is ambiguous and makes evaluation of 
individual role-performance difficult.. A probability model of expected 
distribution of name orders is used in measuring preferences for particular 
sequences, and these preferences vary with the authors' eminence.. On the 
assumptions that authors' names are listed in order of the value of their 
contributions, laureates should be first-authors more often than other 
scientists; in fact, they are not.. Instead, they exercise their noblesse 
oblige by giving credit to less eminent co-workers increasingly as their 
eminence grows.. They do so more often after the prize, and eminent 
laureates-to-be forego first-authorship more often than  those as yet 
unrecognized.. The noblesse oblige, however, has its limits; laureates' 
contributions to prize-winning research are more visible than contributions to 
their other research..

Professional Standing and the Reception of Scientific Discoveries
.A
Cole, S.
.W
  The Matthew Effect occurs when scientists receive differential recognition
for a particular scientific contribution depending on their
location in the stratification system.  Merton originally introduced
the concept to explain the allocation of credit among authors of
multiple discoveries or collaborators.  In this paper the concept is
generalized to apply to all scientific work.  If the Matthew Effect
were to operate, the reception of papers of equal quality should be
influenced by the location of their authors in the stratification system.
To test this hypothesis, data are drawn from several studies of
similar design.  In each study we control for the number of citations
papers received at time 2.  This enables us to look at groups of
papers that were judged to be roughly equal in quality at time 2.
We then see whether there were any differences in the reception of
these papers at time 1 depending upon various aspects of the author's
location in the stratification system.  All the data indicate
that assessed quality of papers at time 2 is a more important 
determinant of a paper's initial reception than any of the stratification
variables.  However, the speed of diffusion of papers of equal quality
is influenced by the reputation of the author based on past work
that is being heavily utilized at the time of a new discovery.  The
Matthew Effect also operates for those scientists located at prestigious
points of the social system of science.  All other stratification
variables, including eminence as measured by receipt of awards
did not influence the speed of diffusion.  Data are presented that
indicate that top papers written by high-ranking scientists are no 
more likely to be widely diffused early than are top papers by low-
ranking scientists.  The Matthew Effect also serves to focus
attention on the work of little-known men who collaborate with
scientists of high repute and to increase retroactively the visibility
of the early work of scientists who go on to greater fame.  A discussion
is included of the relevance of these data for the study of
resistance to scientific discoveries.

Involving, Computerizing, Personalizing
.A
Kilgour, F.
.W
  In most libraries most users face a complex, monolithic arrangement
of entries in catalogs and books on shelves.  In classical librarianship no
effort can be made to personalize the listing of titles or arrangement of
volumes for an individual user.  A user is unidentified, and, except for
that small fraction of a percent who consult reference librarians, users 
remain nameless.
  The computer, however, with its superb ability to treat users as
individual persons and events as individual events, possesses the potential
for enabling big libraries to recapture the human qualities of
which classical librarianship has deprived them since their days as
one-librarian libraries.  However, rehumanization is not the only
contribution computerization will make to libraries.
  Developments in modern society are forcing libraries to establish new
objectives.  Contemporary living is information based, a phenomenon
that is outmoding the venerable concept of library function.  As small special
libraries already do, all libraries must participate in the cultural
activities of the individuals in their communities rather than
merely make available a torpid "service." Libraries must look forward to
supplying information to a user when and where he needs it - an
objective impossible to attain with classical library techniques.

OCLC for You - and ME?!
.A
Plotnick, A.
.W
  Sometimes it seems as if the library world has divided into two camps; those
who seem to know all about this thing called "OCLC" and who keep popping that
rounded acronym into their conversation with a certain bromidic effervescence,
and the other camp - plain folk who are happy to take library life one
acronym at a time, as they need it, and who, if pressed, might guess that OCLC
has something to do with, oh, Optical Codes at the Library of Congress?
  Only in Ohio - where the Ohio College Library Center began and where
this national, computerized, bibliographic data exchange continues to grow -
is OCLC universally a library household term, even among computer-phobes.  In
Ohio, most librarians already realize the kind of thing going on at OCLC is
not simply the building up of someone else's data base in little bits and bytes,
but perhaps the biggest revolution in access to library collections since books
were unchained from the shelves.

The American Occupational Structure
.A
Blau, P.M.
.W
  This book is the result of a collaborative effort extending over seven
years.  We have tried hard to make the book a genuine joint product
to which each of us made the contributions he is best qualified to
make.  There is no senior author; the sequence of name is simply
alphabetical, and we have reversed it in signing the preface and elsewhere
to emphasize this fact.  Our collaboration was motivated by our shared
interest in social stratification, our common concern with advancing
scientific social theory on the basis of systematic research, and the
conviction that the inquiry would benefit from the different qualifications
and viewpoints the two of us represent.  There can be no doubt
that our interests in and approaches to sociological problems differ to
a considerable degree.  Although we agree that refining research methods
and advancing social theory are both important, for example, it is
only fair to state that Duncan lays more stress on deriving theoretical
generalizations.

American Overseas Library Technical Assistance, 1940-1970
.A
Brewster, B.J.
.W
     The United States has been engaged in activities known
variously as technical assistance, technical cooperation, or
development assistance for the past twenty-five years.  This
form of foreign aid, either government sponsored or privately
supported, is a twentieth century phenomenon.  The broader
concept, foreign aid or foreign assistance, means providing 
another country with any kind of goods, whether financial,
commodity, or manpower, to almost any purpose, and
extends to antiquity.  Technical assistance, which may be
defined, on the other hand, as the supplying of techniques,
is an outgrowth of the industrial revolution and parallels
America's rise in the nineteenth century to world recognition
as an important industrial and trade power.  Government use
of such aid as an instrument of foreign policy, as well as
the integration of these private and public efforts in the foreign
assistance field, began to develop under President Roosevelt's
Good Neighbor Policy.  This integration soon expanded under
the new cultural relations program which the United
States implemented during World War II to offset the Nazi
propaganda and cultural offensive in Latin America.

Scientific Communication:  Five Themes from Social Science Research
.A 
Menzel, H.
.W
  The recent upsurge of interest in the behavioral aspects of scientific and 
technical communication and information flow has two distinct sources, a 
theoretical one in the development of communication research, and a practical 
one in the concerns of policy makers in scientific organizations and 
information services.
  For some time past, the attention of sociologists and social psychologists 
studying communication processes, once focused on so-called mass phenomena
and mass publics, has turned to the interplay of communication processes with 
more and more definitely delineated and mapped aspects of social structure.  
One aspect of this shift in interest has been the increasing attention paid by 
behavioral scientists to the systems supplying information of a specialized 
sort, and to the publics which are consumers of this specialized information. 
The scientific and applied professions have been most prominent among the 
publics so studied.

Communication Patterns in Applied Technology
.A
Marquis, D.G.
Allen, T.J.
.W
  The preceding papers have addressed themselves
to the study of information flow in a particular
stream of human activity which has been variously called
science, pure science, basic research, or
fundamental research, and which
is only secondarily, if at all, concerned
with the practical utilization of its products.
At this point it is appropriate to note that there is
a parallel activity which includes applied research,
exploratory development, and engineering development.
This second stream of research we will call technology.
Far more is known about the flow of information
among scientists than among technologists.  From
the knowledge that is available, however, we are
led to conclude that the communication patterns  
in the two areas of activity are not only largely
independent of one another, but qualitatively
different in their nature.  This difference is
reflected most clearly in the mechanisms by
which information is diffused within the two
sets of practitioners.  The present paper is
addressed to these differences and to a discussion
of the nature of the communication process between
science and technology.

Bibliographical Citation Characteristics of the Psychological
Journal Network in 1950 and in 1960
.A
Xhignesse, L.V.
Osgood, C.E.
.W
  The aforementioned studies are related to the
problem of information exchange in psychology.
Journals are a part of the formal channel of scientific
communication as well as storage elements for
the summary accounts of research undertakings.
Analysis of bibliographical citations thus can
reveal certain characteristics of the pattern of
information flow created by scientists in their
work.  The potential usefulness of this type of
investigation is increased when it becomes
possible to examine the trends through time of the
communication network under consideration, and also 
when different communication networks can be compared.
  The present paper deals with some of the
characteristics of bibliographical citations in the
same 21 psychological journals published both in
1950 and in 1960. The list of journals used, along
with the abbreviations to be used here, is given in
Table 1; it includes 8 journals published by the
American Psychological Association and 13 journals
published by other organizations.

Scientific Communication:
Its Role in the Conduct of Research and Creation of Knowledge
.A
Garvey, W.D
Griffith, B.C.
.W
  There is considerable apprehension today
within the scientific community over the
communication crisis in science.  The present
article, which attempts to clarify certain aspects
of the problem, overviews the data collected by the
APA Project on Scientific Information Exchange in
Psychology, together with data which we have
more recently obtained relative to other disciplines.
Such a reexamination of the data should help to
clarify APA's relationship to the many information
media involved in the communication process
which begins with research and ends with the
incorporation of research findings into psychological
knowledge.

Ecological Correlations and the Behavior of Individuals
.A
Robinson, W.S.
.W
  An individual correlation is a correlation
in which the statistical object or thing
described is indivisible.  The correlation
between color and illiteracy for
persons in the United States, shown later in
Table 1, is an individual correlation, because
the kind of thing described is an indivisible
unit, a person.  In an individual correlation
the variables are descriptive properties of
individuals, such as height, income, eye
color, or race, and not descriptive statistical
constants such as rates or means.
  In an ecological correlation the statistical
object is a group of persons.  The correlation
between the percentage of the population
which is Negro and the percentage of the
population which is illiterate for the 48
states, shown later as Figure 2, is an 
ecological correlation.  The thing described
is the population of a state, and not a single
individual.  The variables are percentages,
descriptive properties of groups, and not
descriptive properties of individuals.

Priorities in Scientific Discovery: A Chapter in the Sociology of Science
.A
Merton, R.K.
.W
  We can only guess what historians of the 
future will say about the condition of
present-day sociology.  But it seems
safe to anticipate one of their observations.
When the Trevelyans of 2050 come to write that 
history - as they well might, for this clan
of historians promises to go on forever -
they will doubtless find it strange that so
few sociologists (and historians) of the
twentieth century could bring themselves,
in their work, to treat science as one of the
great social institutions of the time.  They
will observe that long after the sociology of
science became an identifiable field of
inquiry, it remained little cultivated in a
world where science loomed large enough to
present mankind with the choice of destruction
or survival.  They may even suggest
that somewhere in the process by which social
scientists take note of the world as it is
and as it once was, a sense of values appears
to have become badly scrambled.

Social Factors in the Origins of a New Science: The Case of Psychology
.A
Ben-David, Joseph
.A
Collins, Randall
.W
   The uninterrupted growth of a scientific field depends upon the existence of 
a scientific community permanently devoting itself to the field.. Therefore, the
new idea is not sufficient to start the take-off into sustained growth in a new 
field; a new role must be created as well.. In scientific psychology, this 
occurred in the late nineteenth century in Germany.. Using Germany as a 
positive case, and France, Britain and the United States as negative cases, it
is shown that the new role resulted from academic career opportunities favoring
the mobility of practitioners and students of psychology into other fields, and
from the relatively low academic standing of speculative philosophy and its 
consequent receptivity to persons and ideas which promised to turn the study of 
the human mind into an experimental science..

Scientific Output and Recognition:
     A Study in the Operation of the Reward System in Science
.A
Cole, Stephen
.A
Cole, Jonathan R.
.W
   The relationship between the quantity and quality of scientific output of 
120 university physicists was studied.. Although these two variables are highly
correlated, some physicists produce many papers of little significance and 
other produce a few papers of great significance.. The responses of the 
community of physicists to these distinct patterns of research publication were
investigated.. Quality of output is more significant than quantity in eliciting
recognition through the receipt of awards, appointment to prestigious academic
departments, and being widely known to one's colleagues.. The reward system 
operates to encourage creative scientists to be highly productive, to divert 
the energies of less creative physicists into other channels, and to produce a 
higher correlation between quantity and quality of output in the top departments 
than in the weaker departments..

Nobel Laureates in Science:
 Patterns of Productivity, Collaboration, and Authorship
.A
Zuckerman, Harriet
.W
   Nobel laureates in science publish more and are more apt to collaborate than 
a matched sample of scientists.. Interviews with 41 of 55 laureates and 
comparison of their research output with the output of the matched sample 
indicate that these patterns hold at every stage of the life-work-cycle.. As
laureates report and as their publications collaborate, they exercise noblesse
oblige in arranging co-authorship in collaborative publications.. Receipt of 
the Nobel prize is followed by declining productivity and changed work 
practices, as a result of changed role obligations and activities.. Reductions 
in productivity are more severe for laureates who experience comparatively 
large increments in prestige through the prize than for those who were already 
eminent.. The prize generates strain in collaborative associations so that most 
of these terminate soon after the award..

Visibility and the Structural Bases of Awareness of Scientific Research
.A
Cole, Stephen
.A
Cole, Jonathan R.
.W
   The paper contains an analysis of several aspects of the communication 
process in science.. Using data obtained from printed sources and questionnaires
mailed to university physicists, the conditions making for high visibility of a
scientists' work are studied.. Four strong determinates of visibility were
found: the quality of work, as measured by citations; the honorific awards 
received for work in physics; the prestige of the physics department to which
the scientist belong; and speciality.. Quantity of output, age, and 
name-ordering patterns on collaborative papers have no independent effect on 
visibility.. Just as some physicists may be easily seen (i.e., have high 
visibility), other are in positions where they may easily see.. This latter
characteristic is called "awareness"..The data indicate that awareness is high 
in all sectors of the population studied.. Variables such as age, rank of 
department, and quality of work made for only minor differences in awareness.. 
We conclude that the communication system in physics operates efficiently..

Social Structure in a Group of Scientists:
 A Test of the "Invisible College" Hypothesis
.A
Crane, Diana
.W
   The existence of social organization within a research area may be inferred 
(a) if scientists who have published in the area have more social ties with one 
another than with scientists who have not published, and (b) scientists who 
have published in the area can be differentiated by degree od social 
participation within the area.. Using the mail questionnaire, sociometric data
on different types of scientific relationships were obtained from scientists, 
all of whom had published in a particular problem area.. Respondents chose
scientists who had not published in the area as often as they chose scientists
within the area.. Analysis of direct and indirect ties, using Cleman's method
for analysis of sociometric connectedness, revealed that a tie with one or more
of the highly productive scientists brought other scientists of less
productivity into a large network of influence and communication.. Similarities
between this type of social organization and that of the "social circle" are
discussed..

Growth and Decay Curves in Scientific Citations
.A
MacRae, Duncan Jr.
.W
   In a rapidly advancing scientific discipline, new contributions will 
supersede older ones.. This selection in favor of recent literature should be
observable in the distribution of footnote citations in a given discipline, by
age of article cited.. However, the age distribution of citations also depends
on the rate of growth of the disciplinary literature.. The effect of growth of 
the literature and of selection favoring recent articles can be separated, if
certain assumptions hold, by use of an exponential model that expands and 
clarifies earlier findings by Price.. This model provides a reasonably good fit
to age-distributions of footnotes in several disciplines, and its application 
suggest that citations  in sociology tend to refer to older articles than those
in the natural sciences..A parameter in the model, measuring the degree of
selectivity in favor of recent articles, can be estimated and may be useful in
comparative studies of the communication systems of various disciplines..

The Structure of Scientific Fields and 
  the Functioning of University Graduate Departments
.A
Lodahl, Janice Beyer
.A
Gordon, Gerald
.W
   Kuhn's concept of paradigm suggests that academic disciplines could be viewed
as technologies involving degree of task predictability.. A series of hypotheses
were developed in which relatively high paradigm development in a discipline was 
predicted to facilitate research and teaching through improved processes of 
communication and access to stored information.. Using questionnaire data 
collected from 80 university graduate departments, physicists and chemists were 
found to exhibit more agreement over field content, and to be more willing and 
satisfied to spend time with graduate students than sociologists and political 
scientists.. In addition, chemists were found to collaborate with larger 
numbers of graduate students in research than scientists in the other fields..
Two other aspects of scientific structure are discussed: the level of innovation 
being pursued within a field of a given time, and the degree of 
institutionalized differentiation of the field into subdisciplines..

Productivity Differences among Scientists:
  Evidence for Accumulative Advantage
.A
Allison, Paul D.
.A
Stewart, John A
.W
   The highly skewed distributions of productivity among scientists can be 
partly explained by a process of accumulative advantage.. Because of feedback
through recognition and resources, highly productive scientists maintain or
increase their productivity, while scientists who produce very little produce
even less later on.. A major implication of accumulative advantage is that the
distribution of productivity becomes increasingly unequal as a cohort of
scientists ages.. Cross-sectional survey data support this hypothesis for
chemists, physicists, and mathematicians, who show strong linear increases in
inequality with increasing career age.. This increase is highly associated with 
a changing distribution of time spent on research.. Another implication of 
accumulative advantage is also corroborated: the association among productivity,
resources and esteem increases as career age increases..

The Distribution of Social and Cultural Properties in Informal Communication
 Networks Among Biological Scientists
.A
Mullins, Nicholas C.
.W
   Informal communication among biological scientists forms a discernible 
social structure.. This research analyzes the relation of that structure to (1)
scientists' descriptions of their research and the orientations that underlie 
those descriptions, (2) social status in science, and (3) the formal social 
categories of science (i.e. discipline, department, and research organization)..
Each of the observed structures is contrasted with a random model.. Neither 
social status nor the formal social categories show greater association on the
social structure than to the random model.. The culture of science, on the other
hand, as represented by description of research and the orientations underlying 
those descriptions, shows very strong associations with the discerned network 
structures..

The Gatekeepers of Science:  Some Factors Affecting
the Selection of Articles of Scientific Journals
.A
Crane, D.
.W
  The norms of scientific behavior as
described by Merton include the
prescription that scientific achievements
are to be judged without reference to
scientists' social characteristics.  This
article will attempt to assess the extent
to which this norm is followed with
respect to the evaluation of articles by
scientific journals.

Bibliographical Reference Patterns in Core
Sociological Journals, 1965-1966
.A
Lin, N.
Nelson, C.E.
.W
  The present study attempted to extend previous work on
bibliographical reference patterns in sociological journals
in the following ways: (1) by selecting for study those
journals to which American sociologists prefer to submit
their work, (2) by including, over a two-year period, all
bibliographical references (journals, books, technical
reports, etc.), and (3) by including, for initial comparison,
a journal from the physical sciences.  Such a study, it was
hoped, would yield data concerning similarities and
differences among the sociological journals and between
the sociological journals and the physical science journal.

Sociology Today:  Lacunae, Emphases, and Surfeits
.A
Brown, J.S.
Gilmartin, B.G.
.W
  In sociology today, as in other sciences, the professional
journals serve as major channels for the dissemination of
ideas and information.  The papers presented in the
principal periodicals reach a wide audience among sociologists,
are acknowledged as the best work, and stand as
models for all who aspire to success.  The viewpoints, conceptual 
schemes, interests, and methodologies reflected in
these articles are therefore significant influences on both
the current character and the future development of our
discipline.

Measuring the Quality of Sociological Research:
Problems in the Use of the Science Citation Index
.A
Cole, S.
.W
The Problem of assessing the "quality" of scientific
publications has long been a major impediment to
progress in the sociology of science.  Most researchers
have typically paid homage to the belief that quantity of
output is not the equivalent of quality and have then gone
ahead and used publication counts anyway (Coler, 1963;
Crane, 1965; Price, 1963; Wilson, 1964).  There seemed
to be no practicable way to measure the quality of large
numbers of papers or the life's work of large numbers of
scientists.  The invention of the Science Citation Index
(SCI) a few years ago provides a new and reliable tool
to measure the significance of individual scientists'
contributions.  Starting in 1961, the SCI has listed all
bibliographic references appearing in an increasingly large
number of journals.  The number of citations an
individual receives may be tabulated and used as an indicator
of the relative scientific significance or "quality" of that
individual's publications.

  This book is intended to supply the background needed for
participation in the analysis and design of information-handling
systems and for understanding the literature in the field.
I have tried to present a unified approach to the subject
and to the relation of information retrieval to other
disciplines and an appreciation of the importance of this
interdisciplinary relationship.  I hope that the scientist
or computer programmer, newly interested in information-retrieval
problems, as well as the librarian, will find the book of value.

Analysis of Library User Circulation Requirements
.A
Trueswell, Richard W.
.W
   This research study is concerned with the use of the last circulation date 
as a statistic to help describe library user circulation requirements.. Some 
decision rules were developed to use this parameter as an aid in determining the
number of copies of books to be held in the library and as an aid in the
weeding of books from the library's holdings.. The effect of these decision
rules on the circulation requirements of users as well as on library operations 
are described.. The method of data collection is described in detail and is 
applicable at libraries having comparable charging systems.. Cumulative 
distribution functions of last circulation date at two large college libraries 
and a public library were prepared and have been plotted for both circulation 
data and stack holding data.. This same data has also been plotted by subdivided
subject category.. Circulation operating characteristics were prepared for all
three libraries..

   Due to the fact that scientific-technical research is constantly increasing,
it is becoming more and more difficult to retrieve the published results of 
research.. A new field of science, documentation, has been developed as a 
contribution to the removal of this difficulty.. Depending on the type and 
extent of the subject different methods for its documentation will be followed..
Methods and possibilities for the comprehensive documentation of chemistry and 
its related fields are explained..

TOSAR - A Topological method for the Representation of Synthetic and 
Analytical Relations of Concepts
.A
Fugmann, Robert
Nickelsen, Herbert
Nickelsen, Ingeborg
Winter, Jacob H.
.W
   In mechanized systems used for searching in literature stores there is a 
steadily growing necessity not only to be able to formulate concepts as a
search condition but also the characteristic connections under which these
concepts appear in the inquiry.. In this way the precision of the mechanized
literature search is considerably increased.. TOSAR has been developed in 
order to improve computerized literature searching in this respect..

  In the literature, active network plans and developments appear to cluster 
in three main areas: (1) Education, (2) Libraries, and (3) Government, Industry,
and Professional Societies.  These network groupings are described in this
chapter following a discussion of network definitions, concepts, and current
impetus.  References to information systems are included when there is an 
indication that a particular system will probably be transformed into a network.

Design and Evaluation of Information Systems
.A
Katter, R.V.
.W
  In corresponding chapters of earlier volumes of this review 
may be discerned a trend toward progressive broadening of
content coverage.  The initial emphasis was on design and
evaluation concepts and on techniques that were rather closely -  
and narrowly - connected with information storage and retrieval
systems.  It is becoming increasingly clear, however, that
there are many activities and ideas outside of this context
that have, or can have, a very important bearing on the work
of systems analysts, designers, and evaluators working on
library and documentation systems.  This chapter attempts
to continue enlarging our perception of the range of reported
activities that can help to improve the kinds of systems in which
our readers are chiefly interested.

Document Dissemination
.A
Landau, H.B.
.W
  This chapter is directed to those whose vocation (or avocation)
is information.  While we may call ourselves librarians, information
scientists or technologists, abstractors and indexers, documentalists,
IS&R specialists, literature searchers, and so forth, we all have one
thing in common: We are either directly or indirectly involved in the
dissemination of information.  As disseminators, we are interested
in far more than the techniques for transmission of information from
one point to another.  Despite McLuhan's (93) statement that "the
medium is the message," we must concern ourselves with not only the
means of document dissemination, but also the content and value of
the documents we disseminate.  This idea is prevalent throughout
most of the papers reviewed in this chapter.  A disseminator should
think of himself as a selective switching center, inputting data,
evaluating them, selecting worthy items, and directing and controlling
their transmission to a target: the reader.

Information Networks
.A
Overhage, C.F.J.
.W
  The rapidly growing rate at which information is produced and
used in our complex society has presented us with major problems
in information transfer.  We encounter these problems not only
in libraries, information centers, and schools, but also in many
of the operations of government and business.  The handling of large
amounts of information is becoming a dominant theme in the management
of our way of life.  We are a technologically oriented society, and
we have naturally turned to our communications technology to help
us perform our enormous information transfer task.  Beginning with
the telegraph and continuing through the telephone, through radio 
and television to the communications satellite, the methods of
electrical signal transmission have served to distribute information
to its ultimate users.

Annual Reviews of Information Science and Technology
.A
Cuadra, C.A.
.B
1972
.W
  In spite of concerns expressed in the literature about
the health and vigor of the field of information science and
of its service-oriented institutions - libraries and information
centers - the progress reviews in this volume provide grounds for
optimism.  Some of the trends that were commented on in Volume 6
have proved to be solid and important.  For example, the movement
toward rapid interactive access to major public and commercial data bases 
is not very strong, and it will probably not be many years before
satisfying experience with this new mode of information access will
help it become not merely an experimental innovation but the
standard means of searching and using centrally (or regionally)
held data.  Three chapters in this volume touch on related aspects 
of the movement: Bennett's review of the user interface in interactive
systems, Gechman's report on machine-readable bibliographic data bases, and
Brandhorst and Eckert's review of document retrieval and dissemination
systems.
  This volume also introduces a new Annual Review topic of potentially
great importance for future libraries: video cartridges and cassettes.
It is widely accepted that libraries and information centers will, in
the coming years, shift the balance of their holdings in the direction of
some of the newer media, and the chapter by Kletter and Hudson helps to define 
the potential and problems of some of the promising new media.  Other new
areas of interest are information system applications in the criminal
justice system and information system applications in the humanities.
  In addition to these topics, this volume covers three of the core areas
of information science, which we attempt to review on as close to an
annual basis as possible: information needs and uses, document description
and representation, and organization of information.  This
coverage is consistent with a newly developed Annual Review master
plan for cyclic but flexible coverage of some 40 major areas of interest
in library and information science.

The User Interface in Interactive Systems
.A
Bennett, J.L.
.W
  The digital computer has been used as a problem-solving tool for only
two decades.  During most of this time, computer scientists have
concentrated on learning how to build the tool: applying electronic
technology, arranging for data flow between components, and manufacturing
the hardware.  Now we are entering a new stage in which computing
power is made available through interactive terminals to people who
are not computer scientists.  This is possible on a large scale only
because design and marketing innovators now have confidence in their
ability to provide reliable, cost-effective service to less sophisticated
users.  In this new stage, the natural behavior patterns of users become
an important element in the design of the interface to the tool.

Machine-Readable Bibliographic Data Bases
.A
Gechman, Marvin C.
.W
   The advent of machine-readable data bases is one of the most significant 
forward steps in information retrieval.. Currently, the creation and 
application of these data bases are in a period of very rapid growth.. This
reviewer sees a great need for a review of "what is going on" because there is 
so much going on.. It is the goal of this chapter to fulfill that need even 
though it is difficult to hold this dynamic field static for a good meaningful 
look..

Annual Reviews of Information Science and Technology
.A
Cuadra, C.A.
.B
1974
.W
  The major trends of the 1970's in information system planning and
services are becoming clear, as indicated in this year's Annual Review
chapters.  The movement toward inter-institutional operations, or networking,
began gaining force in the 1965-1970 period, through the establishment
of many new library consortia, and there were some tentative efforts
to use computers for nationwide bibliographic information "utilities."
These movements are now more vigorous and are showing signs of being
cost-effective, productive ventures.  Inter-institutional cooperation not only
promises service improvements and cost reductions, but also poses new
problems and demands.  Formalized cooperation among different institutions
requires agreement about needs and priorities and gives special importance
to a clear understanding of the information needs of specific user
subgroups.  It also requires more careful and productive system planning
and design, including intelligent consideration of the "make versus buy"
issue.  Several chapters in this volume touch on these problems and
considerations.
  One of the most significant developments in 1973 was the rapid growth
in the use of on-line information retrieval services - both those operated
by the federal government and those operated by the private sector.  The
apparent cost-effectiveness of these services is raising some of the same
problems for data base producers that inter-institutional cooperation among
library and information facilities is raising for the publishers of printed
materials: namely, how to cover rising costs in the face of declining (or less
rapidly growing) sales of individual units of the product - monographs,
serials, secondary information publications, or magnetic tapes.  The
inclusion of a chapter on copyright - the first in the Annual Review series -
reflects the importance of this topic in the growing controversy over the
ownership and distribution of information.  Another aspect of that
controversy - the role of government and non-profit information services
in relation to those of private industry - is explored in this year's
chapter on document retrieval systems and techniques.

Use of Machine-Readable Data Bases
.A
Williams, M.E.
.W
  This is the first Annual Review chapter entitled "Use of Machine-
Readable Data Bases."  Therefore, the coverage provided is for more than
a one-year period.  A chapter by Gechman (79) on machine-readable
bibliographic data bases included literature from 1969 through 1971.  A
chapter by Housman (100) covered the use of data bases for selective
dissemination of information (SDI) and a chapter by Parkins & Kennedy
(153) has previously reviewed secondary information services.  This
chapter will cover the 1973 literature on data bases as well as earlier
data base papers not treated in prior chapters.
  For purposes of this chapter, a data base is considered to be an
organized set of machine-readable records containing bibliographic
or document-related data.

Design and Evaluation of Information Systems
.A
Swanson, R.W.
.W
  The co-joining of "design" with "evaluation" that is called for by this
chapter posed organizational and inclusion-exclusion problems for the
author.  In part, "design" and "evaluation" prescribe two separate sets
of activities, the former pertaining to the planning, development, and
testing of new information system structures and modification of existing
structures, the latter to appraisals and assessments of operational
systems and system components.  However, "design" includes not only the
formulation of goals and objectives for systems but also provisions for
evaluation in accordance with expectations.  "Evaluation" applies to
testing design concepts and to trying out preliminary implementations
for the purpose of improving initial designs, as well as to the
appraisal of operating systems.  Appraisals at any stage of system
operability may yield data that indicate the need for system modifications
that require redesign and assessment.  Thus, portions of "design" and
"evaluation" are closely interrelated, as Katter demonstrated in
his 1969 review.
  "Design" and "evaluation" may be examined methodologically or with
respect to outcomes of the application of methodologies.  Increasingly,
designers and evaluators have been acknowledging the dependence of
outcomes on sound procedural conceptualizations.  The current literature
discloses research on the processes of design and evaluation as well as on
their products.

Generation and Uses of Machine-Readable Data Bases
.A
Schipma, P.B.
.W
  This chapter continues the coverage of the generation and use of
machine-readable data bases inaugurated in Volume 9 by Williams (178).  It
is therefore an update consisting primarily of 1974 material and is prepared
in general accordance with Williams's initial compilation.
  The same definition of data bases and the boundaries of their applications
used in Volume 9 are continued this year.  A data base is considered
to be an organized collection of machine-readable records containing
bibliographic and/or document-related data (e.g., index information).
The data bases that we will consider are used for information storage
and retrieval and/or research in information storage and retrieval or
data base generation.
  The choice of these constraints precludes coverage of several areas.  First,
data bases primarily concerned with numerical or other nonbibliographic
information, such as chemical structures, (Milen et al., 112) are excluded.
Thus, even though the Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) Registry Number
is a data element common to many bibliographic data bases, papers such as
that by CAS regarding progress in building the Registry System itself (39)
are excluded.  Similarly, though some textual and bibliographic material
is included in the Systems Consultants, Inc report (156) to the Navy, most
of the information retrieval is concerned with miniaturized hardware in a
shipboard environment and thus is not considered within the scope of this
chapter.  Finally, though many of the data bases are used for generation
of publications via phototypesetting, we are not considering that production
operation.

Cooperation in Information Activities Through International Organizations
.A
Adams, S.
Werdel,J.A.
.W
  International cooperation in the processing, sharing, and transfer of
scientific and technical information takes many forms and can be
accomplished through many agencies.  This chapter proposes to review
the role played by international organizations in stimulating and
providing channels and mechanisms for such cooperation.  The international
organizations to be discussed are of two types: intergovernmental organizations
(IGOs), in which member nations participate through their governments under
formal treaties or agreements; and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs)
where, with some exceptions, participation is through national professional
societies or nongovernmental institutions.  The specialized agencies of the
United Nations, including UNESCO, fall in the first category; organizations
such as the International Federation for Documentation (FID) are in the
second.

Introduction to the ADI Annual Review
.A
Cuadra, C.A.
.B
1966
.W
  Over the past 15 or 20 years, a new and growing field of inquiry
has begun to take shape.  This field, which will be referred to as "Information
Science and Technology," draws on fragments and fringes of a number
of sciences, technologies, disciplines, arts, and practices.  The element
that provides whatever degree of cohesiveness now exists in the field is a
shared deep concern with "information" - its generation, transformation,
communication, storage, retrieval, and use.
  Because of the universality of information processes, and also because
of the variety of backgrounds of those concerned with them, there is very
little agreement about the boundaries of Information Science and Technology,
or about its parentage, its essential nature, or its future.  To put it
simply, at the present time there is no clearly defined and well-understood
field of Information Science and Technology.  There is not, truth to tell,
even clear agreement on what the word "information" itself means and
particularly on whether it implies a creative act of the intellect or a
commodity that can be embodied in documents, transported, and exchanged.
Distressing as this ambiguity and lack of agreement may be, they need
not and do no preclude a constructive review of topics of current interest
to users, designers, and students of information systems and services.
The purpose of the ADI Annual Review series, initiated in this volume,
is to provide such a review.

Information Needs and Uses in Science and Technology
.A
Menzel, H.
.W
The way in which scientists and engineers make use of the information
systems at their disposal, the demands that they put to them, the
satisfaction achieved by their efforts, and the resultant impact on their
further work are among the items of knowledge which are necessary for the wise
planning of science information systems and policy.  Besides, these
matters can be of great significance to the behavioral scientist interested
in human organization and communication.  While "user studies" have
not yet gone very far in serving either of these functions, the end of 1963
seems to have been something of a take-off point for empirical research
on the information needs and uses of scientists and technologists.  For
this first volume of the Annual Review, we shall therefore cover studies that
made their appearance as far back as the last month of 1963, to give the
reader a rounded picture of a period during which this area of research
has witnessed progress along the following lines:
    Substantial advances in the more systematic and fruitful application
  of a technique (critical incidents) that had made its appearance in
  this field earlier in less rigorous forms;
    The introduction of at least two very promising approaches (solution
  development records; comparison of research teams working on identical
  tasks) quite different from any that had been applied to this field before; 
  and
    An increase in the number of efforts at comprehensive study of the
  information-flow situation in given disciplines, one of which [American
  Psychological Association (3)] has become the model and envy of research
  in this area.

Evaluation of Information Systems and Services
.A
Rees, A.M.
.W
  This chapter summarizes and discusses the present state of the art in
testing and evaluation.  Three tasks will be undertaken: to outline in
some detail the few substantive research projects involving testing and
evaluation, to describe a number of research projects in areas cognate to
testing and evaluation, and finally, to provide some general conclusions
with respect to past and future activity.  Although a distinction is made
in this review between laboratory-based experimentation and tests of
operational systems, the methodology used in each instance is substantially
the same.  As yet, no full-scale and elaborate field approach has been
attempted.

Design of Information Systems and Services
.A
Borko, H.
.W
  This review has selected for emphasis reports on concepts of systems
analysis and on the procedures for applying these concepts to the design
of information systems.  Literature dealing with the automation of libraries
and information centers has been explicitly excluded, while material on
user studies, file organization, evaluation, etc., is only mentioned briefly
since it is covered more thoroughly in other chapters.
  The selected, relevant, and available literature that has been published
in the last year or so is organized into four groups as follows:
     1. Articles that help define the process of systems analysis and
     the relationship to information science.
     2. Articles that describe the concepts of systems analysis as
     applied to the analysis and design of information systems.
     3. Articles primarily concerned with the design of document
     storage and retrieval systems.

The Annual Review of Information Science and Technology
.A
Cuadra, C.A.
.B
1968
.W
  The Annual Review of Information Science and Technology is now in its
third year.  Like its two predecessors, this volume attempts to describe and
evaluate the most significant work that has been reported in the field
during the past year, with the ultimate aim of improving both our standards
and our means of professional communication.
  The field of information science and technology continues to evolve and
grow.  As it does, new areas of interest emerge and established areas of
interest change in importance.  Accordingly, our pattern of coverage
changes.  The single chapter on Automation in Libraries and Information
Centers, in Volume 2, has been expanded into two chapters, one covering 
automation of technical processes and the other covering document
networks, and a new chapter has been added on information system
applications in education.  Such applications are important not just because
they involve, in part, libraries and other information facilities but
because they highlight innovative ideas and techniques that should be of
value to anyone interested in the total communication process.
   At the same time, "core" chapters of the review are continued:  information
needs and uses; content analysis, specification, and control; file organization
and search; publication and distribution techniques; automated language
processing; man-machine communication; information system design and evaluation;
and professional aspects of information science.
These topics are of continuing and vital interest to our readers, and their
annual literature is significant, large, and growing.

Information Needs and Uses
.A
Paisley, W.J.
.W
  Information science meets behavioral science in the study of information
needs and uses.  At first, the meeting of these fields was inconclusive.  Until
the mid-1960's, there were only a few substantial studies of information
needs and uses.  Since about 1963, however, a significant literature has
grown rapidly.
  There is evidence now of a productive entente between the fields.
When information scientists see reliable, valid, and nontrivial data on
users' behavior, they begin to use behavioral criteria in evaluating
information system performance.  When behavioral scientists glimpse the
full complexity of dissemination, documentation, storage, and retrieval
processes, they offer fewer naive solutions to "the information problem."
  This mutual education and accommodation will undoubtedly continue.
Information science and behavioral science need each other.  Big Science
needs them both.

The Annual Review of Information Science and Technology
.A
Cuadra, C.A.
.B
1969
.W
  This, the fourth volume of the Annual Review of Information Science and
Technology, is both like and unlike its predecessors.  The basic objective -
to provide the most comprehensive and technically sound progress review
ever prepared in the information science field - remains the same, as do the
basic areas of interest and coverage.  Too, the primary emphasis continues
to be on published literature and reports, to permit the reader to identify,
locate, and examine interesting and important sources of information
about various aspects of our technical progress.
  Some new areas of growing importance are introduced this year.  For the
first time, a chapter on reprography and microfilm technology and one on
the international aspects of information transfer have been included.  Also,
the topics of document dissemination and the secondary services, usually
covered in parts of other chapters, have full and separate chapters this
year.  Another change, made in response to suggestions from readers for better
signposts within each volume, is the division of the book into several
major segments, each introduced by a short description of the contents of
the section, the relationships among the chapters within it, and, in some
instances, one or two highlights of the year's technical progress.

Information Needs and Uses
.A
Allen, T.J.
.W
  Previous authors in this series, writing on this subject, have usually felt 
it necessary to begin with a statement concerning the state of the
methodology of "user" studies.  They have, for the most part, found it
improved over the past, and this year is no exception in that regard.
There remains, however, the tendency on the part of many who are untrained
in social science methodology to assume that the art of questionnaire design
and administration is a very simple one that anyone with intelligence can
master in a single attempt.  One never realizes how truly wrong this view is
until he finds himself the author of a review chapter and is then confronted
with the sort of trivia that many authors submit as research papers.

Annual Review of Information Science and Technology
.A
Cuadra, C.A.
.B
1970
.W
  The field of information science and technology continues to grow
and, as it grows, to show new emphases and explore new areas of interest.
Volume 5 reflects these changes.  The increasing interest in
and movement toward library networks and other cooperative,
technology-supported information activities have helped to focus
special attention not only on data processing and microfilm technology,
the two traditional mainstays of library and document-handling systems,
but also on the rapidly developing capabilities in modern tele-communications.
Thus, a chapter on communication technology has appeared, for the first
time, to bring readers up to date on changes in the communications industry
that have had or will have a great impact on how we design and use
information-handling systems.
  Two other first-time chapters cover management information systems
and information systems in state and local government.  While
the intent behind the development of such systems, and the kinds of
services they provide, is peripheral to the purposes and services of
library and document-handling systems, one often sees in these peripheral
areas some information parallels.  Indeed, one of the reasons for the
Annual Review's covering one or more of these areas each year is to
help its readers exploit more fully the thinking and the problem-solving
techniques they are fostering.

Application of Computer Technology to Library Process: a syllabus
.A
Becker, J.
.W
  The application of computer technology to library and
network processes and services is not an end in itself, but
rather a means of narrowing the gap between the demand
for library services and the ability of libraries to provide
those services.  Libraries have assumed the active role of
serving the informational, educational and recreational needs
of the population.  The size of that population grows constantly,
its educational level keeps climbing, and its percentage of
leisure time is increasing.
  The application of computer technology to libraries,
especially to the manipulation of bibliographic records in
the performance of library functions, is a complex process
and demands the highest level of talent of both the library
and computer professions for its accomplishment.  It cannot be
accomplished by either profession alone; rather, the design
of a library system is a team effort between librarians,
computer system analysts, and programmers.  Even a
limited effort demands careful long-term planning if it is to
fit with later efforts into a cohesive whole.  The smallest
project will affect nearly all operations of the library.  For
these reasons it is necessary that all library staff have at
least a general overview of what library automation is all
about.

  A distinct characteristic of man is the need to communicate and
record knowledge.  The tools of communication have ranged from clay to
satellites.  Civilized societies have taken great pains to place recorded
knowledge in safe places and create archives and libraries for this
purpose.
  The importance of recorded knowledge for survival and progress is
constantly being elevated as more and more information is presented.
Without information and its necessary control, a society is not only
stagnant, but regressive.  With social memory, preserved and controlled
by archives and libraries, a society is able to evolve to whatever future it
is destined to experience in an ever-changing environment.
  Archives were the forerunners of libraries.  The ancient archives
contained the best of society's accumulated knowledge; and as nations
grew in wealth and security, archives and libraries become symbols of a
country's aspiration to create a better society.  Today, archives and
libraries are necessities.  These cultural institutions pass information to
succeeding generations in a variety of forms of distributable media.  In this
way, archives and libraries preserve the memory of civilization and pass
this memory on to living individuals.  The materials in these institutions
contain the written and graphic record of social memory and human
heritage and provide society with information on which to base actions,
develop policies, ascertain rights, educate, and entertain.

The Area Specialist Bibliographer: an inquiry into his role 
.A
Stuart, R.D.
.W
  It is the intent of this volume to develop a model designed
to eliminate present difficulties and ambiguities and
to improve administrative procedures for future development
of area programs.  This will be accomplished by giving
some indication of the climate of opinion toward area specialist
bibliographers and by isolating factors which influence
these opinions.  These attitudes will be presented by the
perceptions of area bibliographers toward their role and the
expectations of faculty and library administrators toward that
role.  The bibliographer's academic, professional, and
educational experience will be examined in this framework.

The Art of Computer Programming
.A
Knuth, D.E.
.W
  The process of preparing programs for a digital computer is especially
attractive because it not only can be economically and scientifically
rewarding, it can also be an aesthetic experience much like composing
poetry or music.  This book is the first volume of a seven-volume set
of books that has been designed to train the reader in the various skills
which go into a programmer's craft.

ASIDIC Survey of Information Center Services
.A
Williams, M.E.
.W
     The data in that survey covered the year 1971.  Many recipients
of the 1972 document have requested updated information.  Accordingly,
the ASIDIC Cooperative Data Management Committee initiated a new survey.
The questionnaires were mailed out in January of 1975 and responses
came in throughout the year.  Questionnaires were sent to all member
organizations of ASIDIC and EUSIDIC.  Questionnaires were also sent
to individual members of ASIS SIG/SDI and SIG/UOI.
     Responses received throughout 1975 were checked and tabulated in
1976.  Because of the time delay in producing the final compilation
the reader is warned against using this survey as an up-to-date source
for information as to which centers are processing which data bases.
     Of the 116 responding organizations 75 process data bases and
41 use data base services either as end users or as brokers.  Of the 75
that process data bases (i.e., spin tapes) 51 (68%) are members of ASIDIC
and/or EUSIDIC.  This survey provides representative data for data base
processing organizations.  The use of online search services was
relatively new in 1974 hence data regarding online users would not be
representative of the 1976 online situation.

Research on Users' Needs: Where is it Getting Us?
.A
Hanson, C.W.
.W
  Since Bernal made his pilot survey of the use of scientific literature
for the 1948 Royal Society Scientific Information Conference, at least
three dozen other investigations have been reported of the needs of
scientists and engineers for information, of their information gathering
habits, and the use to which they put information.
  Some of these have been concerned with the people in individual
organizations, but have implications elsewhere.  Others, including
Aslib's own investigations, have had wider aims.  Some have been
based upon observations and records of what the scientists and
engineers themselves did or said, and some upon records of the demands
they made upon libraries.  There have been both surveys of opinions,
and collections of facts.

The Cranfield Tests on Index Language Devices

   The investigation dealt with the effect which different devices have on the
performance of index languages.. It appeared that the most important 
consideration was the specificity of the index terms; within the context of the
conditions existing in this test, single-word terms were more effective than 
concept terms or a controlled vocabulary..

Current Awareness Searches on CT, CBAS and ASCA
.A
Abbot, M.T.J.
Hunter, P.S.
Simkins, M.A.
.W
  During the past year we have been one of the organizations
participating in the Chemical Society's experiment on the use
of routine computer searches of Chemical Titles (CT) and Chemical-
Biological Activities (CBAC) for current awareness.  For some
time we have also been subscribing to the Automatic Subject Citation
Alert (ASCA), which is produced by the Institute for Scientific
Information as a by-product of the Science Citation Index.  These
three sources differ in their scope and methods, but share the
same ultimate objective of providing a computer-based current
awareness service.
  CT covers journals in all branches of chemistry, but provides only
authors and titles, the latter translated into American and edited by 
breaking down complex words so that word fragments can be retrieved.
CBAC covers only papers on the interaction of chemical compounds with
biological systems, but provides abstracts which are available for
computer search.  The computer can also search for molecular
formulae and for Chemical Abstracts registry numbers of all
compounds included in the abstracts.  ASCA in its original form
was based on citations: the search profile can consist of a list of
references to older work, and the output is then a list of new papers
citing this work.  Last spring ASCA introduced a 'term search', which
is a search for words in the titles of current papers and is therefore
analogous to a CT search.
  This paper discusses and compares the results we have obtained so
far with these three services, and the potential use of systems of
this type.

Thesaurus Compilation Methods:  A Literature Review
.A
Blagden, J.F.
.W
  This review has been sponsored by the Office for Scientific
and Technical Information and the end product of the complete
research will be a thesaurus of management terms.  Parallel research
in the business management area and also supported by OSTI is being 
conducted by David Dews, Librarian of the Manchester Business School,
and K.D.C. Vernon, Librarian of the London Graduate School of
Business Studies.  As Mr. Vernon is at present engaged in the
construction of a faceted classification scheme for management,
this investigation has concentrated on the possibility of utilizing
faceted techniques to construct such a thesaurus.
  A study of existing information retrieval systems in the
management field has already been made, so a decision to adopt
some form of post-co-ordinate indexing was assumed.  Thus a comparative
study of other systems will not be attempted.  A decision has also
already been made that a controlled vocabulary, i.e. a thesaurus,
was eventually going to be developed despite the latest Cranfield
results that appear to provide evidence of the superiority of
natural language over controlled vocabularies.  This was primarily
because these results were restricted to tests on an aeronautical
collection, and it may well be that the natural language of this
discipline is in itself a fairly controlled one, which is
certainly not the case with the rather 'soft' language of
management.  This is borne out to some extent by Halkin, who
quotes relevance figures for coordinate indexing applied to organic
chemistry (55 percent), engineering (35 percent), and social
science (20 per cent).
  Machine methods of term generation as described by Ovchinnikov,
Mastermann and Luhn will not be considered, as there is no equipment
available to prepare thesauri on the lines these authors suggest.

Criteria for Evaluating Technical Library Effectiveness
.A
Wessel, C.J.
.W
  In July 1966 John I. Thompson & Company accepted a contract with the
Picatinny Arsenal, US Department of the Army, to perform a study aimed
at developing 'Criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of library
operations and services' under the ATLIS Program (Army Technical
Library Improvement Studies).  The study was divided into three
phases aimed at:
    I A Literature search to reflect the current 'state-of-the
      art' covering library standards and the methods of evaluating
      libraries developed up to the present.
   II A phase in which to gather and evaluate any data required from
      Army Technical Libraries, from available surveys already
      published, or from any other sources, by which to develop
      criteria.
  III A phase in which to establish and validate the criteria.
  Phases I and II of the study are now complete.  Phase III is in progress
and is expected to be completed by the late fall of 1968.  The reports of
Phases I and II are already available for detailed study and that of
Phase III will be available soon.  The purpose of this paper is to present
some of the findings of the study.

The UDC in its International Aspects
.A
Lloyd, G.A.
.W
  Universal Decimal Classification - dying duck or live bird? - or some
such title - was suggested to me, but this is highly debatable, and there will
hardly be time for the duck-shooters to develop a concerted onslaught in the
half-hour or so allowed us for discussion.  Besides, I hope to be able to
convince you - if the BSI's fine efforts have not already done so - that the
UDC is by no means the dying duck - certainly not the dead duck - that some of
its severest critics seem to imagine.  Perhaps the bird has ceased to soar as
it once did in the times of Otlet, La Fontaine, Bradford and Donker Duyvis, but
that it is still viable in the turbulent air of current documentation may be
gauged from a recent FID inquiry aimed at obtaining figures for the
distribution of UDC editions and an approximate estimate of the number of
users throughout the world.

Subject Relations in Science/Technology Literature
.A
Earle, P.
Vickery, B.
.W
  The analysis of citations has often been employed to indicate the use
of the literature of science and technology.  Citation is only an indicator
of use, not an accurate measure, and like all such indicators has defects.
Differences between indicators have been discussed elsewhere.
  Despite these defects, an examination of citations does enable one to
sample acts of literature use within a large community.  The study reported
here was directed, in fact, to all United Kingdom authors of science/
technology publications in a given year, and because of its width, and the type
of analysis performed, is considered to be worth reporting.  The study was
primarily undertaken to obtain comparable information about social science
literature, and this has been reported elsewhere.

Letter to the Editor:  Assessment of Information Services
.A
Davison, P.s.
.W
  May we please raise four questions which are important at the present time
when government policy on information retrieval is being considered? These
arise from results recently produced by SDC which are germane to Dr.
Somerfield's paper on 'Computer-based Information Services' (Aslib
Proceedings, 20, 12, 542-50 (1968)), and to OSTI's work in this field.
  The SDC is making comparisons of the efficiency of various published
indexes and other sources of scientific information and the first results
of rigorously checked comparisons are becoming available for a case study
on the subject of 'Computers Related to Mass Spectrometry'.  This results
from an extensive literature search prepared by combining and collating
results of searches in twelve of the world's major indexes to chemistry and
spectroscopy, including searches of SDC's own data bank files.  Nearly
two hundred unique references on 'Computers Related to Mass Spectrometry'
were found and are being checked individually for relevance going back
to the original paper or asking expert opinion where necessary.

On the Design of Information Systems for Human Beings
.A
Line, M.B.
.W
  Planning of any kind can be motivated by a pressing practical problem which
has to be solved - for example, an increasing number of people may have to be
housed in the same area; or by a long-term idealistic vision; or by both
(the idealist seeing the long-term implications of an immediate problem).  In
short-term planning, the danger exists that the more technical problems may be
solved, without attention to their implications for human beings; to take
my housing example, higher and higher flats may be built, without considering
the possible effects (e.g. the effect on social groupings).  In long-term
planning, Utopian or ideological blueprints may be produced.

Standard Costing for Information Systems:
Background to a Current Study
.A
Robertson, S.E.
Reynolds, R.
Wilkin, A.P.
.W
  For some time past, interest has been developing within the Aslib Research
Department in the problems of establishing standard costs for information
systems.  A literature search recently conducted by the Department (R.
Reynolds) has revealed a scarcity of usable information on this subject:
such data as is available is difficult to evaluate comparatively because
of the differing definitions of the operations costed and of the terms used to
describe them.  It would seem, therefore, that a first step towards developing
a costing method of widespread application would be the establishment of
standard conventions for the analysis of information systems.
  One might postulate two possible ways of arriving at comparative costs for
these systems, namely:
(a) General survey method:  The overall costs of a large number of information
    systems are broken down into a small number of categories, and analysed
    for correlation (see, for example, C.J. Wessel et al).
(b) In-depth study:  A small number of systems are studied in detail in an
    attempt to establish the true sources of the costs and factors affecting
    them.
  In a current project, we are attempting to apply method (b) to the production
of current-awareness bulletins.  An outline of some of the preliminary work in
this project follows.

An Information Retrieval Language for MARC
.A
Austin, D.
.W
  I see from the programme that I am supposed to talk on an information  
language for MARC, and it is true that the work I have been doing for the past
year or so has been under the auspices of the MARC Project.  But the subject
indexing system we have developed is concerned as much with BNB's plans for
computer production from 1971 as with the MARC tapes as such, and I hope to
show that we have also gone some way towards developing a compatible
general system with even wider application.  Before coming to this, however, it
is necessary to describe briefly some of the day to day pressures of work which
caused BNB to look to the computer for help.  From this we can see how the
computer forced us to reconsider our whole approach to subject indexing.

Analysis and Organization of Knowledge for Retrieval
.A
Farradane, J.E.L.
.W
  In a university, the mode of research is usually what is called 'pure' or
'basic' research; since I am keeping in mind primarily the applications of
information science, I will prefer the word 'basic', although there is not so 
much difference.  In such research, and really in any good research, one should
not be collecting data haphazardly.  One must isolate and define a problem and,
as far as possible, control other conditions so that interfering factors are
eliminated.  Preferably one will narrow down the problem to manageable
proportions.  It is then essential to approach the problem with some sort of
hypothesis or theory of the situation, and to concentrate on obtaining
evidence for or against that hypothesis.  The important task is to devise just 
that crucial experiment which will give the answer as efficiently as possible.
If the answer disproves the hypothesis, one has at least further evidence upon
which to construct a different hypothesis; if it confirms the hypothesis, one
is ready for a further step forward, and so on.  Research is easier in a
fully controlled and reproducible situation; in a biological or human
situation one must often have recourse to statistical methods, but this does
not alter the general methodology.  On the whole, I find a clear methodology
lacking in much that is being done in the field of information science today.

User Studies:  A Review of the Literature from 1966 to 1970
.A
Wood, D.N.
.W
  My terms of reference when asked to prepare this review of user studies were
to bring Fishenden's work up to date.  This was published in the Journal of 
Documentation in September 1965 and in his paper he looks at a limited number
of British use studies and draws some broad general conclusions relating to the
development of a national information service.  The present paper which covers
the literature back to the beginning of 1966 is somewhat more detailed.  It
considers a wide range of investigations into the information gathering habits 
of scientists, engineers, social scientists and others, and reports results 
which it is hoped will provide managers with information on which to develop
policies regarding library and information services at all levels.  Although
an increasing number of studies is being carried out in Eastern Europe and
in the USSR there has been no major work reported and consequently the review
considers mainly British and American investigations.

Library and Information Science Abstracts: The First Two Years
.A
Gilcrist, A.
Presanis, A.
.W
  With the thirteenth issue affected by the recent postal strike, now seems
an opportune moment to take a look at the performance of LISA in its first two
years.  This bi-monthly abstracts service succeeded the former Library Science
Abstracts in 1969 as a joint venture between the Library Association and Aslib.
A recount of its birth and a brief report on early progress both appeared in
1969.

The Information Uses and Needs of Social Scientists:
An Overview of INFROSS
.A
Line, M.B.
.W
  When INFROSS began in the autumn of 1967, although a large number of
studies had been conducted into the requirements of scientists for information,
very little had been done in the field of social science information.  There are 
a number of possible reasons for this.  Social scientists, faced with a much 
smaller total volume of information, were much less information-conscious and
less inclined to seek for solutions.  There are very few specialist libraries
in the social sciences, and few librarians were therefore confronted with
social scientists' information needs in the same way as librarians in 
scientific libraries were confronted with users and their problems.  Finally,
until OSTI came along there was little in the way of funds to support this
kind of research.  This almost total absence of previous research had its
disadvantages and advantages.  There were very few clues to guide us, and we
were therefore working to a certain extent in the dark.  On the other hand,
we had a clean and open field uncorrupted by confusing and non-comparable
studies.  There is something to be said for being one of the first in a field.

SDI:  Some Economic and Organizational Aspects
.A
Dammers, H.F.
.W
  In the context of the present symposium it would seem appropriate that
I should deal specifically with the economic aspects of Selective Dissemination
of Information (SDI) operation and use.  In my opinion the technical 
feasibility and merits of SDI have been adequately demonstrated; the main
barriers hindering general use, however, tend to be of an economic nature.
  At Shell Research in Sittingbourne we have been operating, since 1967, an
SDI service for the research staff and it has grown rapidly, particularly
since we started to use the CA Condensates tapes early in 1969.  In addition
to these tapes we are currently using the BA Previews tapes, AGDOC tapes
(prepared by ourselves using punched card input received from Derwent) and,
on an experimental basis, Toxitapes, produced by BIOSIS, Philadelphia.
All these tapes are searched locally, involving the running of around five
hundred profiles weekly.

The Theoretical Foundation of the IDC-system:  
Six Postulates for Information Retrieval
.A
Fugmann, Robert
.W
  Successful delegated searching for publications relevant to the topic of
an inquirer obeys rules whose relations to thermodynamics are unmistakable.
By the continuous growth of a documentation system in the physical and
conceptual respect, steadily increasing demands are made on the degree of order
which prevails in the system or can be established at the specific request of
an inquirer.  If the order in a system cannot keep pace with the increasing
requirements, its working capability will continuously decrease, because
the searcher is becoming more and more overburdened in relation to his
available search time, search patience, and search memory.  The degree of
order attainable in a growing literature collection can be estimated on the
basis of six postulates.  The better the requirements imposed by these
postulates are approximated in a practical documentation system, the higher
are its working capability and life expectancy, but the expenditure to be
made on the literature analyses must also inevitably be higher.
  The establishment of these postulates originated from practical experience
with the IDC-system and its precursors.  These postulates form the basis
of this system and of its further development.

The Future of Scientific and Technological Publications
.A
Smailes, A.A.
.W
  I am sure you do not need reminding of the flood of scientific information
that is available today and the estimates of its growth in the next two
decades.  In 1967, Olaf Helmer, then Senior Mathematician at the Rand
corporation, forecast that scientists and engineers would increase from
five million, in 1967, to twenty-five million by the year 2000 and their
total productivity would go up by a factor of ten.  He declined to assess
the associated growth of, and need for, scientific information but merely
stated that there would be substantial changes in the way in which science
would actually be transacted.  It is these 'substantial changes' that concern
the publisher, editor, information scientist and librarian, because if we
do not anticipate - or at least keep pace with these changes - then we will
not be able to meet the information needs of our readers and we will become
redundant.  Scientific information is a growing industry and it would be
ironic if we could not survive amid an abundance of information.  I regard
the chance to do something about the flow of information as a response to 
opportunity, not as an act of desperation.  The big problem is to sort out
what is pertinent among this information and, in this world of rapid change,
select and develop the technological devices that will match the needs of
the scientist to this mass of information.

Rationalization of Serial Holdings in Special Libraries
.A
Houghton, B.

Prosser, C.

   This paper describes progress which has been made toward the development of
a procedural model intended as a code of good practice to enable special 
librarians to effect economies in their journal holdings by systematically 
planned use of the BLL..
   A theoretical model suggested by B. C. Brookes was tested on various sets of 
usage data from seven special libraries but the results proved to be unrealistic
in terms of immediate provision to the user.. A new experimental approach has 
now been developed based on the total use versus total cost of a journal 
collection..

Aspects of the Theory of Syntax
.A
Chomsky, N.
.W
  The idea that a language is based on a system of rules determining
the interpretation of its infinitely many sentences is by
no means novel.  Well over a century ago, it was expressed with 
reasonable clarity by Wilhelm von Humboldt in his famous but
rarely studied introduction to general linguistics (Humboldt,
1836).  His view that a language "makes infinite use of finite
means" and that its grammar must describe the processes that
make this possible is, furthermore, a outgrowth of a persistent
concern, within rationalistic philosophy of language and mind,
with this "creative" aspect of language use (for discussion, see
Chomsky, 1964, forthcoming).  What is more, it seems that even
Panini's grammar can be interpreted as a fragment of such a
"generative grammar," in essentially the contemporary sense of
this term.
  This monograph is an exploratory study of various problems
that have arisen in the course of work on transformational grammar,
which is presupposed throughout as a general framework for the
discussion.  What is at issue here is precisely how this
theory should be formulated.  This study deals, then, with
questions that are at the border of research in transformational
grammar.  For some, definite answers will be proposed; but more
often the discussion will merely raise issues and consider possible
approaches to them without reaching any definite conclusions.

The Assault on Privacy
.A
Miller, A.R.
.W
  The genesis of this book can be traced to a telephone call I
received during the fall of 1966 from Dr. James G. Miller, then
Director of the University of Michigan's Mental Health Institute
and currently Vice President for Academic Affairs of Cleveland
State University.  He asked what I am sure he thought was a
relatively straightforward and easily answered question:  What
are the legal consequences of computerizing copyrighted materials?
On closer inquiry I discovered that Dr. Miller was exploring
the possibility of using computer technology to develop a national,
multi-media information network, that would electronically integrate
our colleges and universities, eventually providing each of them
a comprehensive and easily accessible pool of scholarly works and
educational services.  He subsequently sought to breathe life into
this idea of promoting the formation of an organization called the
Interuniversity Communications Council (EDUCOM).

An Assessment of Quality in Graduate Education
.A
Cartter, A.M.
.W
  Before this study was begun in the spring of 1964, serious deliberation
was given to the question of American Council of Education sponsorship of
an evaluation of selected graduate programs of major universities that
comprise an important segment of the Council's membership.  There was
never any question about the need for doing in a systematic and objective
way what necessarily goes on continually in any event, though usually
in a piecemeal and more impressionistic way.  Our Commission on Plans
and Objectives for Higher Education, and other leading educators consulted,
concluded that a thoroughgoing study should be made and that the Council's
aegis was a suitable one.

The Association of American Library Schools, 1915-1968:
An Analytical History
.A
Davis, D.G
.W
    The growth of professions has been one of the sociological
phenomena of the past century.  As the strength of
national professional associations of practitioners has increased,
concern with education for the professions has
prompted schools to develop standards and curricula to
support the preparation of practitioners.  During the half
century spanning 1900 the schools in many professions formed
national associations.  The Association of American Medical
Colleges, for example, was established in 1876.  Other professional
school associations followed:  engineering (1893), law (1900),
librarianship (1915), theology (1918), and social work (1919).
These associations, to cite a few, have developed in different ways
while conforming to general patterns and have reached various lvels
of influence in affecting professional education.

As We May Think
.A
Bush, V.
.W
  As Director of the Office of Scientific Research and Development,
Dr. Vannevar Bush has coordinated the activities of some six
thousand leading American scientists in the application of
science to warfare.  In this significant article he holds up
an incentive for scientists when the fighting has ceased.  He
urges that men of science should then turn to the massive task
of making more accessible our bewildering store of knowledge.
For years inventions have extended man's physical powers rather than
the powers of his mind.  Trip hammers that multiply the fists,
microscopes that sharpen the eye, and engines of destruction and
detection are new results, but not the end results, of modern
science.  Now, says Dr.Bush, instruments are at hand which, if properly
developed, will give man access to and command over the inherited
knowledge of the ages.  The perfection of these pacific instruments
should be the first objective of our scientists as they emerge from
their war work.  Like Emerson's famous address of 1837 on "The
American Scholar," this paper by Dr. Bush calls for a new relationship
between thinking man and the sum of our knowledge. - The Editor

Authoritarian Personality
.A
Adorno, T.W.
.W
  This is a book about social discrimination.  But its purpose is not
simply to add a few more empirical findings to an already extensive body
of information.  The central theme of the work is a relatively new
concept - the rise of an "anthropological" species we call the
authoritarian type of man.  In contrast to the bigot of the older style
he seems to combine the ideas and skills which are typical of a highly 
industrialized society with irrational or anti-rational 
beliefs.  He is at the same time enlightened and superstitious, proud
to be an individualist and in constant fear of not being like all the others,
jealous of his independence and inclined to submit blindly to power
and authority.  The character structure which comprises these conflicting
trends has already attracted the attention of modern philosophers and
political thinkers.  This book approaches the problem with the means of
socio-psychological research.

Automated Language Processing
.A
Borko, H.
.W
  The idea for Automated Language Processing was suggested in 1964 at a
time when the research efforts in information storage and retrieval were
expanding at System Development Corporation.  Many people in the company
were directly interested in this area, and an even larger group had interests
that were tangentially related.  A quick and effective means of acquainting
them with the state-of-the-art was needed, but no convenient compilation
of relevant material was available.  It was agreed that a book on the
theory and techniques of information storage and retrieval procedures would
be a worthwhile project for the language processing staff to undertake.
Although no one member could reasonably be expected to cover the entire
range of technical developments in this field, the staff as a whole is
concerned with most phases of the work.  This is attested by the fact that
all but one of the chapter authors were connected with SDC either as
employees or consultants.  The single exception is Pendergraft, for SDC
has had no sustained project in machine translation.  SDC Management was
enthusiastic in its support of the new project.

Automated Keyword Classification for Information Retrieval
.A
Sparck-Jones, K.
.W
  This book is primarily a research monograph, in which the discussion
of the main topics has been broadened so that they are related to their
surrounding context in information retrieval as a whole; it is not a
textbook, and no attempt has therefore been made to justify the choice
of topic, or account for the use of certain concepts, or to provide an
elementary description of either.  For instance in Chapter 1, it is assumed
that the reader is familiar with the idea of using keywords in information
retrieval: I have not considered the relation between this kind of
retrieval device and a controlled thesaurus or descriptor set, or that
between the use of simple class lists as document descriptions and the
use of descriptions with a syntactic structure, for example.  Equally,
in Chapter 2, I have made use of recall/precision ratios as a means of
characterising retrieval performance, without justification or argument;
but this does not mean that I am unaware of the difficulties of doing this,
or of the attention which has been devoted to, and controversy which has
raged round, this subject; it is simply that from the point of view of
my main purpose it is reasonable to use these ratios.

Automation in Libraries
.A
Kimber, R.T.
.W
  My purpose in writing this book has been to try to give an understanding
of what automated systems can do in libraries today.  I have limited
myself strictly to those areas which are commonly termed "library
housekeeping" - the processes of book ordering and cataloguing,
periodicals accessioning and circulation control, whose purpose is to
make a library into an efficient machine for acquiring, storing, and
disseminating knowledge and information.  These are the processes
which can be automated here and now to improve the quality of
service which a library can give to its readers.  I hope that the
descriptions and explanations given here will be of assistance to librarians
in developing appropriate automated systems in their own libraries.

The Automation Survey: Background and Conclusions
.A
King, G.W.
.W
  During the past decade the Library of Congress, in
common with many other research libraries, has become
increasingly aware of pressures and strains in
many of its operations.  These areas of concern (well
known to librarians) include mounting arrearages in
cataloguing and other processing activities; increasing
complexity of manual inventory control files;
increasing difficulty in keeping card catalogues 
reasonably current and accurate; and
increasing demands for a wide variety of services
for a clientele whose needs for information
have grown tremendously since World War II,
and many of whom have only recently turned to
large research libraries for help.  Five years ago an
internal committee of the Library of Congress was
charged to study potential applications of electronic
data processing equipment to Library procedures;
subsequently representatives of three computer firms
made brief studies of Library operations which 
intimated that certain areas could benefit substantially
by automation.

Automated Information-Retrieval Systems (IRS)
.A
Belonogov, G.G.
.B
1973
.W
  It is easiest of all to apply mechanization and automation to the
transmission, accumulation and search of information.  Automation
can also be extended to cover some more complicated functions.  In
all of these cases, the results supplied by automatic devices are
analysed and decisions are taken usually by man.  Thus, the role of
machine is to considerably extend man's capabilities rather than to
completely replace man. 
  The automated systems intended to accumulate and search for information
have come to be called information-retrieval systems (IRS).  These
systems can also perform the simpler forms of data processing.
The physical facilities of these systems are communications equipment,
punched-card computers, microfilming equipment, and electronic computers,
the latter playing the most prominent part.

Medical School Library Statistics
.A
Keenan, E.L.
.W
  At the June 1962 Convention of the Medical Library Association in
Chicago, Illinois, Mr. Stanley Truelson, now Librarian of the University of
Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, circulated a petition
requesting the collection and publication of medical school library
statistics.  Forty-eight medical school head librarians signed the
petition indicating their approval, and a committee for this purpose was formed 
by Dr. Vilma Proctor, Chairman of the Medical School Libraries Group of
the Medical Library Association.
  This committee, composed of Mr. Truelson, Dr.Proctor, and myself,
studied the questionnaires already in use, such as that of the U.S. Office
of Education.  These were rejected as not meeting the needs of our
specialized group of libraries.  As a guide for selecting the terminology
in the questionnaire, we used the American Library Association's Definitions
for Library Statistics; a Preliminary Draft (Chicago, 1961).
  After several drafts, a sample questionnaire was approved by the
committee and distributed to all the medical school libraries in the United
States and Canada.  The Canadian medical school libraries were included
as a result of communications with Miss Doreen Fraser, Librarian of the
Bio-Medical Library of the University of British Columbia and Dr. J.
Wendell McLeod of the Association of Canadian Medical Colleges.

The Contemporary Medical Society Library
.A
Crawford, Susan
Michel, Carol
Waligorski, Conrad
.W
   Four hundred sixty-eight medical societies  in the United States were
surveyed to determine those which sponsor libraries.. Seventy-eight libraries
were identified, of which eighteen are "marginal" and nine are jointly
supported by a medical school and a society, leaving fifty-one relatively
"substantial" libraries whose major support is through society membership..
Characteristics measured include size of collection, types of media, staff,
budget, services, and sources of support.. Questions are raised concerning
the role of the medical library as one institution which participates in the
continuing education of the physician..

   A survey of the circulation of books and journals  at the Downstate Medical
Center Library was conducted, based on cancelled circulation cards accumulated
during a one-year period.. Analysis of the results shows the frequency of use
of various materials by several groups of borrowers and brings out important
differences between circulation of books and that of journals.. One of the
result was the compilation of a list of most frequently used journals.. The 
findings  are graphically represented by several tables and charts..

How Biomedical Investigators Use Library Books
.A
Raisig, L. Miles
Smith, Meredith
Cuff, Renata
Kilgour, Frederick G.
.W
   Relatively few studies have been concerned with the use of biomedical
books.. This paper reports an investigation into use made of library books
by biomedical investigators.. Based on cancelled charge slips collected at the
Yale Medical Library circulation desk, telephone appointments were made to
interview those research investigators whose books has been returned the
previous day.. The interviewer obtained answers from the investigator to a
questionnaire to discover how the investigator had learned of a book, if the
book had been useful, and, if useful, how it had been used.. During the 
six-month study period, 30.4 percent of researchers' volumes returned were
monographs.. Almost four-fifths of books borrowed supplied information wanted,
and about four-fifths of books used had been printed in the previous decade..
Nine-tenths of the use of books was research-related, the other tenth being
for lecture preparation..

An Investigation of the Educational Needs of Health Sciences Library
Manpower:
  I. Definition of the Manpower Problem and Research Desing
.A
Kronick, David A.

.W
   In order to plan adequately for education in health science librarianship
and to be able to project future demands and needs we need to know a great deal
more about existing  manpower in health science libraries.. This paper, the 
first in a series of reports on an investigation to gather this data, discusses
the research methodology and the development of an inventory of the institution
program population upon which the survey is based.. An analysis in terms of 
geographic location, type (educational, research, etc.), administrative 
control, and primary cognate area of these institutions is presented, and their
distribution through the various Regional Medical Library areas is noted..
Preliminary estimates are made, based on questionnaire to the libraries, on the
size of the library population, their relationship to reporting programs or
institutions, exclusive of the hospital population which is being covered in an
independent survey.. A questionnaire to library personnel is underway which
will establish, along with the other questionnaires, a basis for exploring the
relationships which exist between institutions or programs, libraries and
manpower..

An Investigation of the Educational Needs of Health Science Library
Manpower:
  II. Health-Related Institutions and Their Library Resources
.A
Rothenberg, Lesliebeth

.W
   As part of an investigation of health sciences library manpower, the
universe of health-related institutions and programs (excluding hospitals) was
surveyed by postcard questionnaire to produce an inventory and description of
libraries providing services to these institutions reported access to library
resources, indicating usage of some 2,207 non-hospital libraries.. Eighty
percent (2,431) of the institutions reported that the library used was "within"
their own institution; 20 percent (608) noted that the library was "outside"
of their institution..
   The distribution of health-related institutions and libraries is shown by
RML districts, together with relevant census data.. A classification of
libraries, based on the degree of involvement of the libraries' facilities,
resources and personnel in supplying services to health-related institutions,
was developed..
   It is concluded that projections of manpower needs should take into account
institutions and programs not at present possessing health sciences libraries
as well as documented demand in existing health sciences libraries..

   An investigation of the manpower requirements of health sciences libraries
and of educational programs appropriate to these manpower needs was begun in 
March 1968.. To data, 4,727 libraries have been identified as being used by
14,000 health sciences institutions and programs.. Of this total, 2,628 are 
hospital libraries; 1,328 are health sciences libraries; and 771 are academic 
or public libraries..
   Within these libraries some 14,938 persons are directly involved, either
full- or part-time, in the delivery of health sciences library services.. Of
the total work force, 5,861 persons are employed in hospital libraries and
9,077 are employed in health sciences libraries and collections.. The ratio
between professional and nonprofessional employees is 1:2; professional and
nonprofessional status was assigned by the chief librarian.. Survey data
indicate a 7 percent manpower shortage in positions classified as professional,
and a 3 percent shortage in positions classified as nonprofessional..

Kronick, David A.

   A statistical description based on a mail survey of personnel in 2,099
health sciences libraries located outside of the hospital setting is reported..
Respondents to the survey were divided into three groups: professionals (those
possessing a graduate library degree); nonprofessionals (those not possessing
graduate library degree); and chief librarians (those responsible for a
library's operations).. Survey items dealt with education, sex, age, salary,
job mobility and preference for continuing education programs..
   Some 60 percent of the respondents were professionals; 40 percent were
nonprofessionals.. Seven hundred and twenty-eight chief librarians were 
identified in the population: 57 percent were professional librarians while
the remainder were without a graduate library degree.. Approximately 1/5
of all survey respondents were men.. The age distribution for the work force
tended to be bimodal, reflecting the career patterns of women and the later
entry of men into librarianship.. The annual salary for male professionals was
calculated at $12,732; for female professionals at $10,044; for male
nonprofessionals at $7,878; and for female nonprofessionals at $6,313.. Male
professionals were found to have the highest rates of job and geographic
mobility.. Conversely, female nonprofessionals were lowest in mobility.. In
expressing a preference for continuing education programs in library science,
professionals tended to request courses dealing with the organization of
libraries, health sciences institutions and their relationships, while 
nonprofessionals inclined towards courses in technical processing..

Brandon, Alfred N.
.W
   This updated list of 410 books and 136 journals is intended as a selection
aid for the small library of a hospital, medical society, clinic, or similar
organization.. Books and journals are arranged by subject, with the books 
followed by an author index, and the journals by an alphabetical title 
listing.. Items suggested for first purchase by smaller libraries are noted by
an asterisk..
   To purchase the entire collection of books and to pay for the annual
subscription costs of all the journals would require an expenditure of about
12,000.. To acquire only those items suggested for first purchase,
approximately $3,250 would be needed..

MEDLINE Evaluation Study
.A
Moll, Wilhelm
.W
   MEDLINE (MEDLARS-ON-LINE) is the new on-line, interactive bibliographic
searching system which was recently developed by the National Library of 
Medicine.. The system provides users with lists of bibliographical citations
and other information from a three-year file of over 1,250 biomedical
journals.. A survey testing user reactions was conducted at the University of
Virginia Medical Library.. The results of the survey are based on replies by
246 users who requested one or more MEDLINE searches between September 1972 and
March 1973.. The findings indicate that over 93% believe that MEDLINE is a 
substantial improvement over the traditional methods of searching through the
printed indexes.. These respondents also stated that the results of MEDLINE
searches had assisted them in their clinical or research work, or both.. Asked
whether they would continue to use MEDLINE after the imposition of user charges
on July 1, 1973, about 75% said that they would.. The remaining 25% expressed
some reservation and doubts.. The survey gives reason to believe that with the
imposition of user charges the use of MEDLINE will decline..

   ***MEDLEARN***, an orientation to MEDLINE, was developed to educate members
of the biomedical community to become competent on-line searchers.. It appears
in two complementary forms: an interactive terminal presentation available on
the TYMSHARE Network and a supporting hard-copy manual which contains the
didactic portions of the computer program as well as additional items which are
not suitable for on-line presentation.. ***MEDLEARN***, a flexible instruction
tool, is divided into forty sections which may be selected in various sequences
depending on the user's previous experience.. Two MEDLINE simulations and
feedback sections after practice on MEDLINE provide motivation for continued
learning.. The orientation program was evaluated at several medical centers
with uniformly favorable results..

A Cooperative Serial Acquisition Program: Thoughts on a Response to
Mounting Fiscal Pressures
.A
Jones, C. Lee
.W
   A regionally cooperative method of distributing responsibility for every
serial title in a region is outlined.. The system assures the equitable
distribution of the number of titles for which each library is committed..
Later refinements suggest an equalization of cost commitments on the basis of
fiscal resources available for serial purchases.. It is pointed out that fiscal
realities will force some sort of serial acquisition cooperation for all viable
medical libraries..

Use of Medical and Biological Journals in the Yale Medical Library
.A
Kilgour, F.G.
.W
  This paper presents data for the end of 1960 on recorded use of some
two hundred of the most often used scientific and medical journals in the
Yale Medical Library.  The investigation was designed to identify the most
abundantly used titles of recent date of publication to guide the 
acquisition of multiple subscriptions.  At the same time data was collected
to distinguish heavily used back sets.

The Evaluation of Published Indexes and Abstract Journals:
      Criteria and Possible Procedures
.A
Lancaster, F.W.
.W
   This paper describes possible criteria by which the effectiveness of a
published index  may be evaluated and suggest procedures that might be used to
conduct an evaluation of a published index.. The procedures were developed for
the National Library of Medicine and relate specifically to the recurring
bibliographies produced by MEDLARS in various specialized areas of
biomedicine.. The methods described should, however, be applicable to other
printed indexes and abstract journals..
   Factors affecting the performance  of a published index are also discussed
and some research projects relevant to the evaluation of published indexes are
reviewed..

World Biomedical Journals, 1951-60:
     A Study of the Relative Significance of 1,388 Titles Indexed in
     Current List of Medical Literature
.A
Raisig, L. Miles
.W
   This study is an application of the relationship of serial articles
published to serial articles cited, developed in theory in the author's
"Statistical Bibliography in the Health Sciences" (BULLETIN 50: 450-461,
July 1962).. A ranked list of the indexes of significance of most of the
serials indexed in Current List of Medical Literature was derived and erected
from 21,000 citations secured in a random sampling of 1962 and 1961 biomedical
journals regularly received in the Yale Medical Library.. The author measures
the gross indexing effectiveness of Current List against his indexes of 
significance , offers his method  and results as means to reach objective
standards for indexing and abstracting, and projects his results  as measures
of general value of the serials analyzed..

.A
Moll, Wilhelm
.W
   This Basic Journal List of forty-eight journal titles is intended as a 
selection guide for the librarian of the small hospitals.. It is based on a
survey of physicians in Virginia who were asked to review journal titles
contained in the 1967 edition of a list compiled by Mr. Alfred N. Brandon..
The List is designed for the library in a hospital of from 100 to 300 beds and
for the active clinician..

AIM-TWX service at the University of Virginia:
       A Review and Evaluation
.A
Moll, Wilhelm
.W
   The paper reviews the highlights of a four-week trial period (November 19 -
December 18, 1970) during which the Medical Library of the University of
Virginia experimented with a new remote-access bibliographical control and
retrieval system via its TWX machine.. The system, called AIM-TWX, was
sponsored by the Lister Hill National Center for Biomedical Communications
and utilized a time-shared IBM 360/67 computer in Santa Monica, California..
Citations from 109 clinically-oriented  journals from 1966 to date, including
those currently included in the Abridged Index Medicus, may be retrieved
either on- or off-line..
   Various aspects of this service are described, including problems of
staffing, training, and record keeping, as well as the role of the MeSH
vocabulary which is the principle "language" of the man-computer dialog..
   The statistical results indicated that the system was used for approximately
200 minuted on nineteen days and that an average of sixteen searches were run
on any given day, or about 4.6 searches per hour of use.. In spite of an 
inexperienced staff who had little knowledge of the MeSH vocabulary and whose
training schedule was limited to one four-hour session, the experiment was
highly successful in terms of searches and citations..
   At the end of the period, 298 searches had been run for 114 requestors,
and  5,343 citations had been produced.. Only fifty-five searches yielded no 
citations.. The experiment generated a great deal of excitement and interest
among the staff of the Library and of the Medical Center.. Moreover, a large
number of medical practitioners in large and small communities  of Virginia
participated in this experiment, indicating that there exists a great demand
for this type of literature searching which AIM-TWX is able to provide with
great rapidity..

Choosing Physiology Journals
.A
Brodman, E.
.W
  For many years administrators of library collections have sought
objective criteria for assembling well-rounded periodical collections
in the subject fields represented by their collections.  The nearest
approach to any criterion which does away with the a priori knowledge
of the specialist was first suggested by Gross and Gross in 1927.  This
method consists, essentially, of counting the bibliographic citations at
the conclusions of the articles in a basic periodical of the field under
consideration, and of arranging the journals cited in order of the
frequency of their citation.  Thus, in the field of chemistry, the 
references in the Journal of the American Chemical Society are counted and
a list is made of the most frequently cited journals.  According to Gross
and Gross, the journals which are cited most frequently in the Journal of the
American Chemical Society are the most valuable journals for a library
to purchase in order to possess a well-rounded collection in chemistry.
  Although the Gross and Gross method has been in use for almost twenty
years, the fundamental assumptions upon which the method is based have
never been examined.  These assumptions are:
1. The value of a periodical to a professional worker is in direct
   proportion to the number of times it is cited in the professional
   literature.
2. The journal or journals used as the base for the tabulation are
   representative of the entire field.
3. If more than one journal is used as a base, all of them can be weighted
   equally.

Statistical Bibliography in the Health Sciences
.A
Raisig, L.M.
.W
  The sustained interest in documentation, as a key to the retrieval of
information in the literature of the sciences, has obscured largely the
potential utility of statistical bibliography as a method of analyzing
information needs.  In the belief that a discussion of the latter may be
of value to interested biomedical librarians and scientists, a review of
investigative methods and results in the health sciences is offered here.
  Statistical bibliography may be defined as the assembling and interpretation
of statistics relating to books and periodicals; it may be used in a
variety of situations for an almost unlimited number of measurements.
Within the last forty years bibliographical statistics have been collected
and explained in several fields of science for these main purposes: to
demonstrate historical movements, to determine the national or universal
research use of books and journals, and to ascertain in many local
situations the general use of books and journals.

Mechanization of Library Procedures in the Medium-sized Medical Library
.A
Pizer, I.H.
Franz, D.R.
Brodman, E.
.W
  Mechanical means for expediting library work have been considered
for many years, as an examination of the early pages of Library
Journals bears out. The very first volume of the forerunner of the Bulletin,
the Medical Library and Historical Journal, moreover, contained an
article on the use of the "typewriting machine" in cataloging.  Telephones
have long been accepted as library machines, and, except for unusual
items, hand bookbinding has given way to machine-bound books.
  Nevertheless, when the term "machine methods" is used for libraries
today, the prevailing idea is that expensive and complicated electronic
equipment must be employed, and, since few libraries are able to afford
such equipment for themselves, it is generally assumed that none but the
largest libraries (the Library of Congress or the National Library of
Medicine, for example) will be able to employ already existing mechanical
methods or devise systems specifically applicable to their own situations.

Moderately and Heavily Used Biomedical Journals
.A
Fleming, Thomas P.
.A
Kilgour, Frederick G.
.W
   The purpose of this investigation was to produce a title list of current
journals suppling upwards of 75 percent of demand at the Columbia and Yale 
Medical Libraries.. Columbia received nearly 2,000 journals and Yale over
1,500; findings are based upon an analysis of canceled charge slips for issues
published from 1959 through June 1962.. This combined study of recorded usage
for six months in the Columbia Medical Library (12.9 percent of circulation
during January through June 1962) and for one year in the Yale Medical Library
(12.5 percent of 1961/62 circulation) revealed that a core of 262 journals
supplied 80 percent of use of titles published in the 1959 to mid-1962
period.. However, it is probable that current issues of all titles received
were used at least once within the libraries.. Titles of sixty-seven journals
which supplied slightly more than 50 percent of use are listed..

Medical Libraries and the Assessment of User Needs
.A
Rees, Alan M.
.W
   Users of information in science and technology have been studied in great
detail with respect to material read, amount of time spent in reading and
searching the literature, categories of questions asked, an so on.. Probing
for this information has been undertaken by means of structured  and 
unstructured  interviews, diaries, surveys, and questionnaires..
   Although a large amount of data has emerged on information usage and flow,
the subjective response of scientists furnishes comment only on the satisfaction
produced by present information services and does not yield insight into the
extent to which needs remain unsatisfied.. Relevance  figures based upon the
response of systems to questions cannot be equated with satisfaction of needs,
since questions constitute, in most cases, inadequate representations of 
underlying information needs..
   Assessment of the needs of users of medical libraries and information system
must, in fact, be made in relation to the observed behavior and experience of
biomedical scientists.. There is room for well-designed experimentation which
can explore the interaction of both psychological and environmental factors..
Significant differences in information needs exist among and between individuals
such as researches and clinicians  in the same environment.. With respect to
environment, it is hypothesized that the information needs for medical
practitioners in remote areas might differ significantly from those of their
colleagues working in large metropolitan centers in close proximity to medical
schools, research institutions, and other rich sources of information fallout..
   It is anticipated that experimentation will eventually result in a
methodology which will permit the determination and prediction of the
information needs of any identified groups of users in a specific environment..

Analysis of Recorded Biomedical Book and Journal Use in the Yale Medical
Library
Part I. Date and Subject Relations
.A
Stangl, Peter

Kilgour, Frederick G.
.W
   Analysis of book and journal circulation is based on cancelled charge slips
collected over a one-year period in the Yale Medical Library.. About two-fifths
of material circulated	were monographs.. Books and journals in seven subject
fields provided over half of the circulation.. Approximately two-thirds of both
books and journals used had been published during the most recent nine years..
A subject-by-subject examination of the ratio of books to journals circulating
revealed that, in subject where proportionally more journals than books were
taken out of the Library, books were of more recent imprint dates than were
journals, contrary to the overall pattern.. Date distribution of books and
journals by subject was also studied.. Results are illustrated with graphs and
tables..

   Cancelled charge slips collected over a one-year period supply the data for
this analysis of circulation in the Yale Medical Library.. Full-time teacher
faculty are the heaviest users of journal literature, and  students, of
monograph literature.. Faculties of Medical School departments are compared in
terms of their use of material in individual subjects.. Subject literatures are
analyzed in terms of groups of users borrowing from them.. The extent to which
journal titles used by medical students  are also used by Medical School
faculty is examined.. One of the products of the study is a rank list of 
journal titles used in the Library.. Results are presented in several tables..

The Circulation Analysis of Serial Use:  Numbers Game or Key to Service?
.A
Raisig, Miles L.
.W
   The conventionally erected and reported circulation analysis of serial use
in the individual and the feeder library is found to be statistically invalid
and misleading, since it measures neither the intellectual use of the serial's
contents nor the physical handlings or serial units, and is nonrepresentative
of the in-depth library use of serials.. It fails utterly to report or even to
suggest the relation of intralibrary and interlibrary serial resources.. The
actual mechanics of the serial use analysis, and the active variables in the
library situation which affect serial use, are demonstrated in a simulated
analysis and are explained at length.. A positive design is offered for the
objective gathering and reporting of data on the local intellectual use and
physical handling of serials and the relating of resources.. Data gathering in
the feeder library, and implications for the extension of the feeder library's
resources, are discussed..

   In July 1966, the Institute for Advancement of Medical Communication began
work on a project aimed at developing methods for collecting objective data
suitable for planning and guiding local, regional, and national programs to 
improve biomedical libraries and the biomedical information complex.. This
article constitutes an introduction to a series of reports on the methodologic
tools that have been developed.. It describes the overall purpose and initial 
goals of the project, gives the general plan of the work, and presents five
basic concepts that underlie the project's approach and structure the entire
effort..

Development of Methodologic Tools for Planning and
Managing Library Services:
II. Measuring a Library's Capability for Providing Documents

   A method of measuring a library's capability for providing the documents its
users need has been developed.. The library is tested with representative 
sample of such documents to determine how long would be required for users to
obtain these documents.. Test results are expressed in terms of a Capability
Index, which has a maximal value of 100 only if all the sample documents are
found "on shelf".. Specific tests employing samples of 300 documents have been
developed that are appropriate for academic an for "reservoir" biomedical
libraries.. Realistic field trials have demonstrated that these two tests are
practical to administer and that test results are adequately reproducible..
When strict comparability is not important, a library can test itself.. In
assessing a reservoir library, test results are supplemented by data on its
typical processing time for interlibrary loan requests.. Currently these tests
are being used in a national survey.. The general method is applicable to other
types of libraries, provided appropriate test samples are established.. If 
their limitations are clearly understood, these "Document Delivery Tests"
can be valuable tools for planning and managing library services..

   A standardized procedure was developed for eliciting those details for a
library's service policies that are important to its users and for recording
the data by checking appropriate categories on a form.. This inventory 
procedure covers the entire spectrum of user services and accommodates a wide
range of policies.. The inventory was originally designed for use by trained
interviewers in large-scale surveys of academic medical libraries.. However,
it is also suitable for other kinds of libraries, and the Interview Guide and
Checklist can be used for a self-survey by library stuff.. In addition to 
survey use, the inventory has a variety of educational, administrative,
managerial, and research applications.. A methods for weighting the categorical
inventory data to reflect the relative desirability of different policies makes 
it possible to calculate scores indicating how a library's policies compare
with those of an "optimal" library.. An analogous inventory of the services a 
library provides to other libraries was developed for surveying major backup
resources in the medical library system..

Survey of the Card Catalog in Medical Libraries
.A
Pachefsky, Reva
.W
   A survey of present uses and arrangement of medical library card catalogs 
was made in order to determine current practices and trends.. Attention was
focused on the influences of MeSH on the card catalog.. The results indicate
that the prevalent type of card catalog found in medical libraries is the 
divided catalog.. In addition, it appears that this catalog arrangement is 
gaining acceptance, and the trend is toward division.. MeSH has an effect on 
the organization of the card catalog; libraries indicate that it is an 
influential factor in the decision to divide the catalog..

   This paper reports the results of a four-week questionnaire survey carried 
out at the National Lending Library (N.L.L.), Great Britian, to discover which
types of organizations were the principal users of medical literature, what 
types of literature were used, and which were the main sources of references
to medical publications..Industrial organizations and universities accounted
for the majority (62 percent) of the loans, most of which were English-language
periodicals published since 1960.. For the whole sample, citation list in 
periodical articles were the principal sources of references, although for
literature published in the last fifteen months, abstracting and indexing
journals were the main sources.. Of the latter, Index Medicus proved to be the
most fruitful source of references.. By asking whether the item requested was
really useful to their work, a measure of the reliability of the different
sources of references was obtained..
   Appendixes include the questionnaire, a list of the most frequently borrowed
journals, and a list of abstracting and indexing journals used as sources of
references..

Thesaural Problems in an On-Line System
.A
Cain, Alexander M.
.W
   This paper describes the construction of a synonym thesaurus or entry 
vocabulary for the SUNY Biomedical Communication Network, which will permit
the user greater ease of access to MeSH-indexed material without previously
consulting a printed list of indexed terms.. In order to discover the actual
terminalogy used by a researcher, words were extracted from titles of articles
appearing in Index Medicus, and compared with the subject heading under which
they appeared.. As well as strict synonyms, grammatical variants were also 
included.. Work is continuing on relating other indexing vocabularies, such as
Excerpta Medica and Current Medical Terminalogy, used in the biomedical world 
to MeSH terms..

The Role of the Medical Librarian in SDI Systems
.A
Garfield, Eugene
.W
   Many ongoing selective dissemination systems designers assume that the 
librarian can be omitted from active participation in execution of the master
plan.. ISI's four years of experience with ASCA service have shown that 
librarians must be an integral part of the system and engage in a active 
dialogue between users and the machine.. Specific examples of how 
librarians can best serve the information needs of scientists using SDI systems
are examined.. It is the basic contention of this paper that the librarian
should serve as an intermediary between users and the numerous new information
media.. In this manner the librarian can filter and translate the requirements
of individual scientists to conform with the inherent limitations of all
machine systems while exploiting their capabilities to the fullest..

   This annotated list of 178 items is compiled as a guide to the development
of the reference collection in a small medical library..
   Arrangement, following the pattern of the previous revision, is by broad 
subject groups.. Titles are chiefly in English.. Textbooks in subject fields
have been omitted since these are covered adequately in several comprehensive
guides to the literature..

Coordination of Regional Libraries with Regional Medical Program Projects
.A
Kefauver, David F.
.W
   The Medical Library Assistance Act authorized the Regional Medical Library 
Program to improve information services in health fields, as well as other
programs designed to help the health worker.. Both the RMLP and the Regional
Medical Program are based on regional cooperation to enhance the value of 
available resources, and to enable health workers away from main centers to 
use them.. Services with Regional Medical Libraries must supply are described..
As this program develops, more than conventional library services will be
provided..
  Regional Medical Programs stress the continuing education of health-related
personnel, and their need for health information; libraries are necessarily
involved in such programs.. The regions of the RMP are smaller than those of 
the RMLP, and the smaller regional focus may be an advantage..
   Specific examples of the coordination of library services and library-
oriented programs are given..

User Services Offered By Medical School Libraries in 1968:
Results of a National Survey Employing New Methodology

   The breadth and depth of services that ninety-two medical school libraries
offer to individual user were ascertained by interviewing the heads of these
libraries, employing a standardized inventory procedure developed earlier
(Bulletin 56:380-403, Oct.1968).. Selected aspects of the descriptive data 
obtained on services to faculty and to medical students are presented and 
commented upon.. Comparisons with the findings of earlies surveys suggest 
that increases in the stuffs and budgets of medical school libraries over the 
past two decades have gone largely to supporting a rapidly increasing volume of 
service, rather than to any striking increase in the breadth and depth of
services.. To facilitate summarization and comparisons among libraries the 
descriptive data were weighted and converted to quantitative measures; the
weighting scheme was established by a group of five academic medical librarians
to reflect the relative values the group assigned to different services..
One these quantitative measures, the percentage score for overall services
relative to the optimal library, summarizes a library,s services in a single
figure.. On this measure, medical school libraries ranged from 38 percent to 
87 percent; the median overall score was 63 percent.. Results of some 
exploratory analysis are described; these analyses attempted ti find 
explanations for the observed differences among libraries and among geographical
regions on the quantitative measures.. Present and potential uses of the survey
data for managerial and research purposes are discussed.. One of the most
important of these uses is in establishing and implementing standards - 
activities which should be carried out by the library profession itself - and
recommendations are made for a program of such activities that is appropriate 
for the Medical Library Association..

The National Biomedical Communications Network as a Developing Structure
.A
Davis, Ruth M.
.W
   The National Biomedical Communications Network has evolved both from a set 
of conceptual recommendations over the last twelve years and an accumulation
of needs manifesting themselves in the requests of members of the medical 
community.. With a short history of three years this network and its developing
structure have exhibited most of the stresses of technology interfacing with
customer groups, and of a structure attempting to build itself upon many 
existing fragmentary unconnected segments of a potentially viable resource-
sharing capability..
   In addition to addressing these topics, the paper treats a design appropriate
to any network devoted to information transfer in a special interest user
community.. It discusses fundamentals of network design, highlighting that
network structure most appropriate to a national information network.. Examples
are given of cost analyses of information services and certain conjectures are
offered concerning the roles of national networks..

The Medical Library Assistance Act: 
An Analysis of the NLM Extramural Programs, 1965-1970
.A
Cummings, Martin M.
.A
Corning, Mary E.
.W
   The imbalance between medical library resources and information needs of the
health professional led to a reexamination of the mandate for the National 
Library of Medicine.. Legislation known as the Medical Library Assistance Act
(MLAA) was passed in 1965 which enabled the NLM to (1) initiate programs to 
assist the nation's medical libraries and (2) develop a medical library network
with the establishment of regional medical libraries to link the NLM with local
institutions..
   The National Library of Medicine, through the MLAA, has made available $40.8
million to the medical library community under a competitive grant and contract 
mechanism for the period July 1965 - June 1970.. A total of 604 projects has 
been executed in resources, research and development, training, construction,
regional medical libraries, publications, and special scientific projects.. An
assessment is given of each of these programs and their impact on both the 
National Library of Medicine and individual medical libraries.. In the 
aggregate, these programs have significantly improved library and information
services to the professional health user.. The principal limitation has been
inadequate funding to accomplish the level of originally stated objectives..

Review of Criteria Used to Measure Library Effectiveness
.A
Evans, Edward
.A
Borko, Harold
.A
Ferguson, Patricia
.W
   This article reports the results of survey of literature on measures of 
library effectiveness.. This survey led to the formulation of six criterion 
concepts  (accessibility, cost, user satisfaction, response time, cost/benefit
ratio and use).. The advantages and disadvantages of each method of 
measurement are discussed.. Several points which became clear during the 
analysis are discussed.. First, there is a relative lack of concern with the 
rationale behind the evaluation process, although the results invariably lead
to a confused interpretation when there is no clear understanding of the 
purpose of an evaluation.. Second, the total library system is rarely 
considered; instead, each evaluation criterion is taken in isolation rather
than as part of the whole.. Third, the library's preservation function has not
been considered at all..

Document Delivery Capabilities of Major Biomedical Libraries in 1968:
Results of a National Survey Employing Standardized Tests
.A
Orr, Richard H.
.A
Schless, Arthur P.
.W
   The standardized Document Delivery Tests (DDT's) developed earlier (Bulletin
56: 241-267, July 1968) were employed to assess the capability of ninety-two
medical school libraries for meeting the document needs of biomedical 
researchers, and the capability of fifteen major resource libraries for filling 
I-L requests from biomedical libraries.. The primary test data are summarized 
as statistics on the observed availability status of the 300 plus documents in
the test samples, and as measures expressing capability as a function of the 
mean time that would be required for users to obtain test sample documents..
A mathematical model is developed in which the virtual capability of a library,
as seen by its users, equals the algebraic sum of the basic capability afforded
by its holdings; the combined losses attributable to use of its collection, 
processing, relative inaccessibility, and housekeeping problems; and the gain
realized by coupling with other resources (I-L borrowing).. For a particular 
library, or group of libraries, empirical values for each of these variables 
can be  calculated easily from the capability measures and the status 
statistics.. Regression equations are derived that provide useful predictions 
of basic capability from collection size.. The most important result of this 
work is that cost-effectiveness analyses can now be used as practical decision 
aids in managing a basic library service.. A program of periodic surveys and 
further development of DDT's is recommended as appropriate for the Medical

The Implementation, Evaluation, and Refinement of a Manual SDI Service 
.A
Yunis, Susan S.
.W
   The Missouri Institute of Psychiatry Library has implemented an inexpensive,
manual SDI (Selective Dissemination of Information) service based upon the 
monthly issues of Index Medicus.. The implementation and refinement of the 
system are documented, and the very favorable response to the system is 
examined.. The SDI service is compared to Current Contents, with the finding
that 60 percent of the SDI participants prefer it to Current Contents.. For
this select portion of researchers the Index Medicus SDI is the more suitable
mode of current awareness.. For a significant portion of the MIP staff, 
however, the score of Index Medicus is too restricted to suitable replace 
Current Contents.. All SDI users find it highly acceptable curent awareness 
service for use in addition to Current Contents and have indicated the desire 
to continue participation in the service..

A Method of Estimating the In-House Use of the Periodical Collection in the
University of Minnesota Bio-Medical Library
.A
Tibbetts, Pamela
.W
   During two one-week periods in April 1972, information on periodical title 
and date was gathered from  periodicals collected from study and reshelving 
tables of the University of Minnesota Bio-Medical Library.
   It was determined that: (1) a few titles accounted for most of the total 
use; (2) the relationship between age and amount of use of a journal may be
described by the equation y = ke**(-bx); and (3) the last five years of 
publication accounted for 58% of the total use.

A Behavioral Approach to Historical Analysis
.A
Berkhofer, R.F.
.W
  To issue a clarion call for historians to adopt a behavioral
approach to their subject may seem as up-to-date and exciting as
last month's newspaper, for it is the academic fashion today to
argue the utility of social science theory in the writing of
history.  Books and articles issue forth from the presses in
seeming profusion advocating and even occasionally demonstrating
such an approach.  Yet these many pages fail in three significant
ways to accomplish the end they nominally espouse and which I urge.

A Behavioral Theory of the Firm
.A
Cyert, R.M.
.W
  This book is about the business firm and the way it makes 
economic decisions.  We propose to make detailed observations
of the procedures by which firms make decisions and
to use these observations as a basis for a theory of decision
making within business organizations.  Our articles of faith
are simple.  We believe that, in order to understand contemporary
economic decision making, we need to supplement
the study of market factors with an examination of
the internal operation of the firm - to study the effects of
organizational structure and conventional practice on the
development of goals, the formation of expectations, and
the execution of choices.

A Mathematical Theory of Communication
.A
Shannon, C.E.
.W
  The recent development of various methods of modulation such as PCM
and PPM which exchange bandwidth for signal-to-noise ratio has
intensified the interest in a general theory of communication.  A basis for
such a theory is contained in the important papers of Nyquist and Hartley
on this subject.  In the present paper we will extend the theory to include a
number of new factors, in particular the effect of noise in the channel, and
the savings possible due to the statistical structure of the original message
and due to the nature of the final destination of the information.
  The fundamental problem of communication is that of reproducing at
one point either exactly or approximately a message selected at another
point.  Frequently the messages have meaning; that is they refer to or are 
correlated according to some system with certain physical or conceptual
entities.  These semantic aspects of communication are irrelevant to the
engineering problem.  The significant aspect is that the actual message is
one selected from a set of possible messages.  The system must be designed
to operate for each possible selection, not just the one which will actually
be chosen since this is unknown at the time of design.

A Mathematical Theory of Communication
.A
Shannon, C.E.
.W
  In this final installment of the paper we consider the case where the
signals or the messages or both are continuously variable, in contrast with
the discrete nature assumed until now.  To a considerable extent the
continuous case can be obtained through a limiting process from the discrete
case by dividing the continuum of messages and signals into a large but finite
number of small regions and calculating the various parameters involved on
a discrete basis.  As the size of the regions is decreased these parameters in
general approach as limits the proper values for the continuous case.  There
are, however, a few new effects that appear and also a general change of
emphasis in the direction of specialization of the general results to
particular cases.
  We will not attempt, in the continuous case, to obtain our results with
the greatest generality, or with the extreme rigor of pure mathematics, since
this would involve a great deal of abstract measure theory and would
obscure the main thread of the analysis.  A preliminary study, however,
indicates that the theory can be formulated in a completely axiomatic and
rigorous manner which includes both the continuous and discrete cases and
many others. The occasional liberties taken with limiting processes in the
present analysis can be justified in all cases of practical interest.

Bibliographic Control of Nonprint Media

  Educational systems specialists lament the
deplorable lack of organization of nonprint
media for utilization in the learning process.
Audiovisual personnel have, out of despair,
made a painful entry into the world of
bibliography while librarians, long experienced
in the bibliographic control of printed matter,
still appear preoccupied with more conventional
forms of information and reluctant to turn
their expertise to the organization of nonprint
media.

On a Class of Skew Distribution Functions
.A
Simon, H.A.
.W
  It is the purpose of this paper to analyse a class of distribution
functions that appears in a wide range of empirical data - particularly
data describing sociological, biological and economic phenomena.  Its
appearance is so frequent, and the phenomena in which it appears so diverse,
that one is led to the conjecture that if these phenomena have any property
in common it can only be a similarity in the structure of the underlying

Book Availability and the Library User
.A
Buckland, M.K.
.W
  The essentially logistical problem of making library books physically
available when wanted by library users is central to librarianship.  This
book is a tentative attempt to provide a treatise on this problem.  As such
it has to deal with both theoretical analysis and the practicality of
solutions.  No apology is made for the attention devoted to theoretical
analysis, because the author believes that a clear conceptual understanding
of the factors involved is important for improved librarianship.  The
fact that analytical models are not always usable does not mean that the
insight that can sometimes be derived from such analyses will not lead to
a better understanding of the problems and, thereby, to improved library
services.

Book Catalogs
.A
Tauber, M.F.
.W
  In the intervening years since the appearance of the
first collection of papers concerning book catalogs (Kingery,
Robert E., and Tauber, Maurice F., Book Catalogs, N.Y.,
The Scarecrow Press, 1963), attention has been concentrated
on the book catalog as a substitute for, or an auxiliary
to the card catalog.
  This selection of papers has identified some of the
efforts to solve particular problems concerned with book
catalogs.  The published papers, as well as those which
have been written specifically for this volume, bring additional
observations concerning the place of the book catalog in
library services.

Book Publishing:  What it Is, What it Does
.A
Dessauer, J.P.
.W
  We speak of book publishing as an industry and as a profession.
Both designations are certainly appropriate.  Book publishing is
a business conducted, for the most part, for profit.  But its
practitioners - at least those who do it honor - have
motivations that transcend their profit interest.  They know
that books are no mere commodity, no mere items for consumption that
leave their readers much as they find them.  Books, like other vehicles of
information and sources of entertainment can change, influence, elevate,
demean, exalt, or depress those who expose themselves to them.	What
books are and can be depends heavily on the judgement, integrity, taste,
and acumen of those who select and produce them - their publishers.

Book Selection of Censorship
.A
Fiske, M.
.W
  The key question was whether restrictions are being imposed on
librarians, or whether they are imposing restrictions on themselves, that
threaten the citizen's right to easy access to as adequate a collection of
books and periodicals as his community, his country or his state can
afford.  Readers of this report may come to different conclusions about
the "right" answer to this question, but whether they conclude that
librarians are or are not being as forceful as they might be in developing
and upholding freedom-to-read principles, it should not be forgotten
that it is librarians themselves who have had the courage to provide the
evidence.

Book Selection and Censorship
.A
Moon, E.
.W
  When is a librarian's decision not to include a book in his library
collection an act of book selection, and when is it censorship?  Is there, 
in fact, any discernible difference in the two terms: book selection and
censorship?  This topic was discussed so lucidly and ably, long ago, by
Lester Asheim in what has become a classic essay in the literature of
librarianship, "Not Censorship, but Selection," that raising it again
may appear to be an exercise in redundancy.

  This is the second book based on studies into social aspects 
of book reading.
  The present book is largely a report on work which was
carried out in 1967-68 but either not analysed or written
up in time for the first book, or work actually carried out
and analysed during the second year's research.  The reader
of this book will find it useful to have read the first book,
but the present book is self-contained and does not require
reference to the first one.

Books for Junior College Libraries

Ririe, J.W.

  The primary purpose of this publication is to serve as a
book selection guide for junior and community college
libraries, whether long established, newly established, or
in the planning and preinstruction stage.  The need for a
new and authoritative book list has long been expressed
by administrators, faculty members, and librarians.  It is
hoped that the present list will meet this need, and that
it will also be useful in four-year colleges, with special
reference to their lower-division work; in secondary
schools, especially where accelerated and honors programs
or courses for advanced college placement are offered;
and in public libraries seeking to satisfy the demands of
high school and college students.

A Brief guide to Sources of Scientific and Technical Information
.A
Hermer, S.
.W
  This guide is a recapitulation and refinement of the substantive
content of a one-and-a-half day course which was given before
three groups of Federal scientists and engineers during the Fall of
1967.  Its purpose was to train and inform
working scientists and engineers as to the most direct and efficient
means of seeking and acquiring work-related information.
  The impetus for the course was the recognition of the growing
need for working scientists and engineers to share and participate
in the existing and emerging information tools and mechanisms,
and to avail themselves of the opportunities afforded by the newer
approaches to information collection, organization, and dissemination. 
A further, related purpose of the course was to facilitate the
fullest possible participation of the working scientist and engineer 
in the evolution of information services and mechanisms which are
likely to have a greater and greater effect on his professional
activities.

Building Library Collections
.A
Carter, M.D.
.W
  Each year thousands of books are published by the
general, the technical, the governmental and the university
presses in this and other countries.  From this overwhelming
mass of new publications every library must, within the limit
of its funds, select that small part which will be most 
beneficial to the community it serves.  This is properly an
awesome responsibility to the young inexperienced librarian.  To
the competent veteran it is a task which though carried on
week after week never can approach the ease of a well
mastered routine.  Each book examined requires the exercise
of careful judgement, integrity, emotional control at times,
and scrupulous honesty, guided always by a sense of purpose.

CAN/DI system:  User reaction to a computer and information
retrieval system for Canadian scientists and technologists
.A
Wolters, P.H.
Brown, J.E.

  In April 1970, the CAN/SDI project, developed
by the Canadian National Science Library,
completed its first year of operation.  At that
time the project, designed as a national service
to alert scientists and technologists to current
information in specific fields of research, was
serving over six hundred and fifty subscribers
requiring a total of more than three thousand
five hundred individual computer queries.  Over
one thousand personalized bibliographies are
prepared each week from commercially available
data bases purchased from Chemical
Abstracts Service, the Institute for Scientific
Information (ISI) and the British Institution of
Electrical Engineers.  A detailed description of
the service was given in a paper by J.E.
Brown published in October 1969.

Case Studies in Library Computer Systems
.A
Palmer, R.P.
.W
  Case Studies in Library Computer Systems does not follow the mode of
the other volumes in this series because none of the persons, libraries or
systems is disguised.  Neither has information been withheld to force readers
tp explore alternative choices, as in the usual case method.  Rather, all
systems are identified and described as accurately as possible.  Descriptive
case studies are problem-oriented, however, because they analyze a situation
in which a librarian had to decide if a computer could be successfully
utilized to solve the problem at hand.  The descriptive case method rather
than the problem case method was chosen because it seemed important to
describe each system in detail and to evaluate its performance in the context
of a real library environment and against the background of particular
institutional service objectives.

Case Studies in Systems Analysis in a University Library
.A
Burkhalter, B.R.
Muller, R.
.W
  The marriage between the University of Michigan Library and
Community Systems Foundation seemed like a sensible step at the
time.  Too often, Library administration found it necessary to choose
between alternate courses of action without having adequate information.
In addition, overburdened department heads rarely found time
to alter their systems substantially to accommodate demands on the
library and their departments, let alone time to make these changes
in a systematic manner which considered the impact on other
departments and carefully weighed alternative solutions.  As a
consequence of this situation, the library administrators were
considering ways of providing staff assistance to themselves and
the department heads, so that alternate courses of action could
be designed and properly evaluated.

.W
  The present study was undertaken pursuant to an assignment
by the Library of Congress.  The author was directed to prepare,
for the Board on Cataloging Policy and Research of the A.L.A.
Division of Cataloging and Classification, a general analysis of the
ALA cataloging rules for author and title entry, with special 
consideration of the rules for corporate authors, and a discussion 
of the objectives and principles which should underlie a revision of the
rules.  The first three parts of the report are directed, respectively,
to the three aspects of this assignment.  The fourth part of the report
was added to deal with general questions raised by readers of a 
preliminary draft of this report.

Cataloging U.S.A.
.A
Dunkin, P.S.
.W
  The book deals almost entirely with theory and principles.  Only
now and then, if it seems necessary to a complete understanding of
the implications of theory, is some detail of practice briefly 
described.
  It follows that the work is not a substitute for rules of entry and
description, subject headings rules and lists, classification schemes, or
other similar reference books.  Instead, it is only a commentary on such
works, and it does not profess to comment on more than a few of
what seem to be the most important aspects of each.
  Comments are made only on cataloging in the United States.
Many interesting practices have always been part of cataloging
abroad.  But to write of these practices also would have taken several
books.  This work looks at the foreign scene only when it seems
necessary to understand fully some procedure in this country.  If a
reader in some other country finds anything in this book helpful,
that will be, I hope, good for him and for his country's cataloging.
I am not at all sure, however, that what we do and think in this
country will be of value in other countries with other conditions.  In
no sense is this a book of American intellectual imperialism.

  The papers in this publication represent the edited oral presentations of
the speakers at the conference.
  The conference theme centered on the implications of cable television for
libraries.  The general purpose of the Institute was to foster greater
understanding about the subject of cable television in the conference
participants.  More specifically, the planning committee for the conference
enumerated the following objectives:
1.  to provide an atmosphere of inquiry focused on the implications of cable
    television for libraries;
2.  to provide consultants and resource people who have knowledge and 
    experience related to the potential of cable television and its implications
    for libraries;
3.  to expand the participants' understandings and perceptions of the
    technology of cable television and its related equipment as they affect the 
    libraries' communications responsibilities;
4.  to suggest some techniques for utilizing cable television in originating 
    local programs, and to explore the possibilities for the varieties of
    services cable television can offer the profession;
5.  to aid librarians in all types of libraries to become aware of the unique
    possibilities for the utilization of cable television in their specific 
    types of libraries, and also to suggest the importance of cable television
    in a systematic approach to library and information networks; and,
6.  to create a growing and continuing consciousness of the problems and
    opportunities for the utilization of cable television in libraries.

Centralized Processing for Academic Libraries; final report of the
Colorado Academic Libraries Book Processing Center; the first six
months of operation
.A
Doughtery, R.M.
.W
    This is the final report of the Colorado Academic
Libraries Book Processing Center (CALBPC)
project.  The CALBPC project was begun in 1965
by nine academic libraries in Colorado in an effort
to establish a centralized acquisition and processing
center.  The report of Phase I-II, completed
in June 1968, dealt primarily with a general feasibility
study, the design of the central system, costs
of acquiring and processing in nine libraries and a
number of related concerns such as accounting, the
congruence of approval plans and user attitudes toward
library services.
    This report focuses on the experimental operations
which were concluded officially on September 30,
1969.  Whereas the Phase I-II study dealt with the
theory and principles upon which a system might
be based, we are presently concerned with the
pragmatics of book processing, the obstacles 
encountered, and the solutions achieved.
    Although this report deals primarily with
cooperative acquisitions and processing, we believe
it also contributes to a better understanding of
cooperative programs.  The experiment was designed
to monitor operations throughout the acquisition/
cataloging cycle.  Performance and cost measurements
were made on most internal and external aspects
of the system.  Monitoring also extended into
the participating libraries where a product
acceptance study was conducted.  A secondary
objective of the project was to observe the 
relationships which formed between the participants
and the central agency, such as the interface of
systems and the human interaction of participants
and the Center.

Carl H. Milam and the American Library Association
.A
Sullivan, P.
.W
  Carl Hastings Milam spent the most productive years of his life in
the positions with which his name is most closely associated, those
of secretary and, later, executive secretary of the American
Library Association (ALA) from 1920 to 1948.  When he became
secretary, the association had already been in existence for forty-
four years.  What kind of association was it that claimed Milam's
allegiance? What experience had he had with ALA before becoming
its secretary?  The answers to these questions lead to better
understanding of Milam, the association, and their close relationship.

  Chemical Abstracts Service, along with the entire ACS publications
program, is converting to a computer base.  This change in our basic method
of handling information will provide powerful new tools for chemists and
chemical engineers to meet their information needs.
  Our goal is a unified system that will produce both a full, printed record
of chemical and chemical engineering knowledge and a variety of timely,
special-subject alerting services, simultaneously providing a mechanized
match and retrieval system that is sufficiently flexible to meet the varied
needs of information users.  The output will be supplied in whatever form
best suits the user's needs - printed pages, microfilm, or computer-searchable
tapes.  Tapes and search programs will be usable on the customer's computer,
or CAS will provide custom matches of its own computer files.

  Abstracts of scientific papers from
journals and other serial publications,
which now make up about 85% of
the abstracts in CA, increased at an
average annual rate of 8.4% between
1961 and 1970, compared with 8.2% in 
the previous decade.  The number of
such abstracts published annually
now is doubling every 9 years.  The
number of patent abstracts increased 
at an average rate of 5% per year in
the 1960's compared with 11.7% in the
1950's.  However, the total number of
patents covered by CA, either by
actual abstracts or through the CA
patent concordance, grew at an
average rate of 10.9% from 1961 
through 1970.

Chemical Information Systems
.A
Hyde, E.
Ash, J.E.
.W
  The purpose of a chemical information system must not be restricted
to the storage and retrieval of facts.  It is equally important that the system
shall provide methods which enable a scientist to assemble and to correlate
the facts.  Chemical information systems are required primarily as a service
to research chemists to enable them to keep up to date with current
developments in their fields of interest, and the establishment of information
services has relieved the chemist of many of his problems of literature
searching and information storage and organization.

What do Chemists Read?

Reuben, B.G.

  Most British universities are spending at least 3000 pounds per year
on chemical journals alone.  And this does not include any administration
or binding costs which may be as much again.  Are the universities getting
their money's worth out of these journals?  This survey of one particular
chemistry department suggests that they are not.

The Civic Culture
.A
Almond, G.A.

  We are concerned in this book with a number of classic themes
of political science: with what the Greeks called civic virtue and its
consequences for the effectiveness and stability of the democratic
polity; and with the kind of community life, social organization, and
upbringing of children that fosters civic virtue.  In using survey
research to study these classic themes, we are also following the
traditional practice of relying on the most precise methods available to
us for the investigation of these problems.  Perhaps Tocqueville and
Bryce, were they living today, would have relied somewhat on
the cross-section survey in their comparative studies of democratic
attitudes.

Classification for a General Index Language
.A
Foskett, D.J.
.W
  The role of classification schemes in libraries and information services
has probably caused more argument than any other professional activity.
This would be surprising if classification were no more than a fairly
convenient way of arranging books on shelves.  Some librarians think it is,
and support their view by heaping scorn on the heads of those who, like the
Classification Research Group, actually spend years of their time in
theoretical discussions that seem to result in more and more abstruse and
difficult complications to what ought to be a straightforward exercise.
Yet today we can see clearly two relatively new spectacles on the library
scene: on the one hand, some librarians are criticizing the Decimal
Classification (especially as used in the British National Bibliography)
for being too detailed and unwieldy; on the other hand, some librarians,
and still more information officers, are busy revising the Universal
Decimal Classification in order to make it more detailed.  In the next
field, as it were, computerized indexing and retrieval systems are pounding
away at the ever-growing masses of literature, producing results that
impress computer specialists but not information users, who are so 
deafened by the noise that they cannot hear what is new.

Classification and Indexing in Science

  The first problem, that of learning of a publication's existence, is
tackled by a multiplicity of abstracting and indexing journals and
other bibliographies, and, at local levels, by library catalogues and
unnecessary overlapping among these services, while ensuring
adequately comprehensive coverage, are very great.  But even if
these were overcome, problems of the internal arrangement of these
bibliographical aids would still remain.  It is not enough for them
collectively to record every scientific publication.  The user must be
able to find every such record, starting only with a subject on which
he wants information.

  The preface to the first edition of this book - which is reproduced
following this - shows that in 1958 the classification ideas in it
were felt to be controversial, needing to be championed.  A few
years before, the Classification Research Group had issued a
memorandum proclaiming 'the need for a faceted classification
as the basis of all methods of information retrieval.'  As part-author
of this memorandum, I must now judge the claim to have been
too bold, even brash.  But it has been vindicated to an extent,
for both in theory and practice the value of facet analysis, in
the organization of subject vocabularies for indexing and search,
has been widely accepted - whether these vocabularies are classified
or alphabetical, and whether used in pre- or post-coordinate fashion.

Classification Practice in Britain.  Report on a survey of classification

Davison, K.

  The objectives of the Sub-Committee in starting their enquiries were
basically three-fold
     1) To gather a reasonable collection of statistics relating to the general
        practice of classification in this country.
     2) To gather information on th actual use of the Dewey Decimal
        Classification in this country.
     3) To provide a basis for the recommendations which are provided
        periodically for the Dewey Editorial Policy Committee from the
        Library Association Library Research Committee's Sub-Committee on
        Dewey Decimal Classification Revision.
To this end a questionnaire was sent out to over 1100 libraries of all types
throughout the country and after six months reminders sent to librarians
to ensure they had received them and that none had been overlooked.  The
result of this was very pleasing; 716 were returned, the vast majority 
completed correctly.  The actual figures of type and size of library are
given in the body of the report but no type of library is completely omitted
and a significant proportion of the larger libraries returned the 
questionnaire.

Classification Scheme for Law Books
.A
Moys, E.M.
.W
  An examination made over a period of years of the principles of
classifying law books for use in libraries, and of their treatment in
many general and specialized classification schemes convinced me that
no scheme existed which was generally suitable for libraries in English-
speaking countries outside the United States.  Law collections in
academic libraries in the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth were
in a particularly difficult position.  They had the choice of adopting one
of the good American schemes, which generally make inadequate
provision for the needs of overseas Commonwealth libraries; or of
adopting one of the English schemes, each of which is virtually tailored
to a particular library, and several of which are even less well suited
to overseas libraries; or of devising new schemes for themselves.  There
seemed to be an urgent need for a practical law classification scheme
capable of being used in a variety of libraries, large and small, general
and special, academic and professional, in these countries.

Classification and Subject Index for a Library
.A
Dewey, M.
.W
  The plan of the following Classification and Index was developed early in
1873.  It was the result of several months' study of library economy as found
in some hundreds of books and pamphlets, and in over fifty personal visits to
various American libraries.  In this study, the author became convinced that
the usefulness of these libraries might be greatly increased without additional
expenditure.  Three years practical use of the system here explained, leads him
to believe that it will accomplish this result; for with its aid, the 
catalogues, shelf lists, indexes, and cross-references essential to this
increased usefulness, can be made more economically than by any other method
which he has been able to find.  The system was devised for cataloguing and
indexing purposes, but it was found on trial to be equally valuable for
numbering and arranging books and pamphlets on the shelves.

Classification Catalogue Code
.A
Ranganathan, S.R.
.W
  The Author, the Dictionary and the Classified catalogues
represent three successive stages in the order of evolution
of the internal form of the Library Catalogue.  The classified
form being the latest to evolve, the literature relating
to it is comparatively scanty.  It is strikingly so in the
form of a systematic code of rules for cataloguing.  While
the number of codes for the Author Catalogue is fairly
large and the number for the Dictionary Catalogue is also
respectable, there appear to be few systematic and complete
codes published in book-form for the Classified Catalogue.
Hence this little venture, which is based on twenty-five
years of experimentation and on the valuable reciprocal
influence gained by its being taught to students of library
science during the last twenty years.
  While the Call Numbers occurring in the examples given
are constructed by the Colon Classification, the rules of
this Code are not necessarily dependent on that scheme for
their applicability.  They are all of general application,
irrespective of the scheme of classification in use.

Cleaning and Processing Bindings and Related Materials
.A
Horton, C.
.W
  The destructive effects of air pollution in the modern city upon
the health of its people, its trees, and its gardens, even its buildings
and statues, are well known and are being increasingly fought
against.  But the public, generally, and even many librarians
and book-collectors, who should know better, are apparently unaware
of the rapid deterioration of the world's libraries under these
conditions.  In libraries, museums, and private homes preventive care
is regularly given to pictures and sculpture, fine furniture, silver
and brass; but the gradually deteriorating volumes on the shelves are
given no more attention than an occasional dusting which abrades
the books more than it protects them.  I would judge that more than
90 percent of the books and documents that come to my bindery
for repair or restoration are in a condition that could have been
avoided by regular and appropriate preventive care.  Unfortunately,
even when the custodians of books become aware of the problem,
they my be handicapped by the relative unavailability of expert
advice on what procedures to follow in conserving their libraries.
The present essay is intended to meet this need.

Code of Cataloging Rules

    The following rules represent a system designed to
produce an instrument essential to the operations and services

apply them properly, it is necessary to comprehend the 
objectives which the catalog is to serve, the method by which
these objectives are to be achieved, the basic aspects of the
problem of cataloging, and the general principles which underlie
the rules.
     Objectives.  The objectives which the catalog is to serve
are two:
     First, to facilitate the location of a particular 
publication, i.e. of a particular edition of a work, which
is in the library.
     Second, to relate and display together the editions which
a library has of a given work and the works which it has of a
given author.

Quantitative Criteria for Adequacy of Academic Library Collection

   The authors challenge accepted doctrine which asserts that the adequacy of 
an academic library cannot be measured by the number of books which it 
contains.. Out of their feeling that the Standards for College Libraries and 
the Standards for Junior College Libraries are inadequate for estimating the 
size (in volumes) required for minimum adequacy by libraries of institutions of
higher education of widely differing characteristics, they developed new 
formulas for this purpose.. These formulas attempt to identify the principal
factors affecting academic needs for books and to ascribe suitable to each
factor.. The authors then illustrate the application of the formulas to 
specific institutions, and conclude that while the results are useful, further 
research in needed.. They end by suggesting specific topics for such research..

System Analysis in University Libraries

   A comprehensive enginnering approach to the analysis and functional design 
of library systems is described in terms of fundamental space-time relationship 
which characterize university libraries.. Long-run trends in aquisitions and
circulation are related to the relative obsolescence of stored materials, and 
the uncertainty of short-run demand pattern is related to the need for excess
service capability.. The spatial dispertion of library resources among 
specialized information centers and central depositories is considered with
respect to availability, retrieval, duplication, and efficient storage..

Subject Specialists in a University Library
.A
Byrd, Cecyl K.
.W
   In an attempt to supply in other disciplines the bibliographical expertise
traditionally furnished by university library systems to departments with 
departmental libraries, Indiana University has over the past three years
established ten subject specialist positions in the social sciences, 
humanities, and area studies programs.. These librarians select materials, 
render reference service to faculty members and graduate students, give 
instruction in library use, and serve generally as the main channel of 
communication between the library and the academic departments to which they 
are allied..

Sampling and Short-Period Usage in the Purdue Library
.A
Jain, A. K.
.W
   Several possible methods of sampling of social science monograph titles in 
the general library of Purdue University were considered, and a "good" method
was used to obtain estimates of their usage in the library and at home during 
the period July 1 - August 4, 1964.. The term relative usage was defined and 
used to study the effect of: (1) language, (2) country of publication, (3) 
year of publication, and (4) year of accession of a monograph title.. An 
attempt was made to fit a regression model for titles in English by quantifying
the last three independent variables with relative usage as the dependent 
variable.. Functions based on the above variables have been developed to 
identify monograph titles for storage..
   A questionnaire was employed to stady the usage of library facilities and to 
gather opinions of library patrons.. Purpose of visiting the library, reason 
for checkout of library material, reason for preferring library or home for the 
use of library material, etc., were analyzed on the basis of the replies 
received..

Conflict in Libraries
.A
Bundy, Mary Lee
.W
   Intergroup conflict in libraries is explored, including conflict between
departments, between professionals and bureaucracy, and between older and newer
staff members.. Other special interests such as informal power-holders and the
subprofessional are identified.. This analysis shows that existing 
organizational relationships in libraries let "means" become "ends".. Strong
forces toward conformity hamper desirable growth and change.. A restructuring
of libraries is proposed along the lines of professional rather than 
semiprofessional organizations.. Principal changes to be made are in existing
processing-service relationships and administrative-professional 
relationships..

Determining and Allocating Book Funds for Current Domestic Buying
.A
McGrath, William E.
.W
   A device is outlined to help formulate the annual book budget request..
Courses described in the college catalog are matched with the books listed in 
the American Book Publishing Record, BPR, Cumulative 1965.. Courses, treated
as if monographes, are designed Dewey classification numbers and arranged in 
decimal sequence by groups.. Books in BPR falling into the groups are tallied;
the DC groups are then rearranged by departments and the number and cost of 
books in each are totaled.. Results are sound estimates of each department's
probable current domestic book needs for that year and may be applied to the 
subsequent year as an estimate of what will probably be needed.. They may be 
used as factors in an allocation formula..

Professionalism Reconsidered
.A
Bundy, Mary Lee
.A
Wasserman, Paul
.W
   The question of librarianship as a profession is considered here in terms of 
the three key relationships of a professional-client, organizational and 
professional.. Professional practice in this field is thus cast against 
accepted norms and standards of professional behavior.. This critical 
assessment suggests that librarianship falls far short of the professional 
model.. Major shifts in the nature of the services performed by librarians
and in their bureaucratic relationships will be required if librarianship is to
advance.. The contributions of the professional associations and of library
schools to the advancement of the process of professionalization is also 
analyzed.. Progress in the field is viewed to be inextricably tied to the 
success or failure which librarianship achieves in its quest for true 
professional attainment..

The Bottomless Pit, or the Academic Library as Viewed from the 
 Administration Building

Munn, Robert F.
.W
   Library administrators could adjudge their likely fortunes in the academic 
tug-of war for funds if they understood more clearly the attitudes of 
institutional administrators toward libraries.. Some view the library as "a
bottomless pit"; all recognize that the library is unlikely to generate much
political pressure for its own aggrandizement.. Many young institutional
administrators are coming to apply more sophisticated measures to their funding 
formulas than have been utilized in the past..Librarians therefore would be 
well advised to become more proficient in modern management techniques and 
program budgeting concepts..

Question-Negotiation and Information Seeking in Libraries
.A
Taylor, Robert S.
.W
   Seekers of information in libraries either go through a librarian 
intermediary or they help themselves.. When they go through librarians they 
must develop their questions through four levels of need, referred to here as 
the visceral, conscious, formalized, and compromised needs.. In this pre-search
interview with an information-seeker the reference librarian attempts to help
him arrive at an understanding od his "compromised" need by determining: (1) 
the subject of his interest; (2) his motivation; (3) his personal 
characteristics; (4) the relationship of the inquiry to file organization; 
and (5) anticipated answers.. The author contends that research is needed into
the techniques of conducting this negotiation between the user and the 
reference librarian..

Measuring Classified Circulation According to Curriculum
.A
McGrath, Wiiliam E.
.W
   Circulation statistics can be precise reflections of library use according 
to the curriculum.. The statistics can help the librarian decide how to 
allocate the budget to departments.. Traditional counts, by department 
personnel or by broad Dewey or LC classes, are imprecise.. An analogy between
curriculum and circulation can be constructed by classifying courses in the
college catalog (by DC or LC), rearranging the numbers thus generated by 
department, and then counting circulation within those groups.. The analogy is
thus a quantitative measure and a precise reflection of library use according
to curriculum..

The Title Catalog: A Third Dimension

   The accessibility of the card catalog seems to be inversely proportional to
the complexity of its arrangement.. A catalog divided into author-title and
subject sequence simplifies the filing order of cards and facilitates the use 
of each catalog.. It is argued here that a three-way division into author, 
title, and subject catalogs will further augment these advantages.. In this 
paper a separation of the title catalog at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee
library is described and evaluated..

An Allocation Formula Derived from a Factor Analysis of Academic Department

McGrath, William E.

Huntsinger, Ralph C.

Barber, Gary R.
.W
   The authors derive a book fund distribution formula from a factor analysis 
of twenty-two variables which measure and quantify academic departments.. The
analysis generates a 22 x 22 matrix of correlations.. A few of the significant
correlations are discussed; e.g. those between books published and books 
circulated (high correlation) and circulation-by-subject and 
circulation-by-person (low correlation).. The factor analysis sorts out the 
complex relationships between the twenty-two variables and reduces them to 
three main factors - two of which seem to describe materials used and users.. 
The third may describe needs.. The three factors are the chief elements in the 
formula.. Each factor can be represented by any one or more of the variables 
in that factor..

   Questions about the accuracy of library records, the behavior or attitudes
of patrons, or the conditions of the books in the collection can often be 
answered by a random sampling study.. Use of this time and money saving 
technique requires no special mathematical ability or statistical background..
The concept of accuracy is discussed and a table is provided to simplify the
determination of an appropriate sample size.. A method of selecting a sample 
using random numbers is shown.. Three examples illustrate the application of 
the technique to library problems..

Program Budgeting and Cost Benefit Analysis in Library
.A
Keller, John E.
.W
   Libraries in academic institutions have traditionally prepared annual
budgets based either upon subjective judgments or upon oversimplified 
formulas.. Two budgeting techniques recently introduced into universities from 
the defense establishment are program budgeting and benefit analysis.. Properly
applied they can be utilized to gain better decisions in problems facing 
academic library managers and improved allocation of library resources..

User Circulation Satisfaction vs. Size of Holdings at Three Academic 
Libraries
.A
Trueswell, Richard W.
.W
   In an effort to determine certain facts concerning the relation of 
circulation satisfaction to collection size, the author sampled the "last 
circulation date" of stack books and of circulated books in three considerably 
different kinds of academic libraries.. The experience of these three libraries 
proved to be surprisingly similar.. The author speculates concerning potential 
uses to which such data might be profitably applied..

The Economic Goal of Library Automation
.A
Kilgour, Frederick, G.
.W
   A steadily increasing rate of productivity should be the economic goal of 
library automation.. Such productivity will be achieved only by development of
a new library technology.. Thereby, rise in library costs, which are going up
exponentially at a frightening rate, will be brought into line with cost rises 
in the economy as a whole..

Classifying Courses in the University Catalog
.A
McGrath, William E.
.A
Durand, Norma
.W
   The authors contrast the university catalog and the card catalog and conclude
that the university catalog is the best guide to the university's current 
scholarly interest.. They urge that librarians study and classify courses 
therein, such as books, using the Library of Congress or Dewey Decimal schemes
so that specific class number are grouped by academic department and become
substantial spans.. The profile can be used as a selection tool, as a 
correlating tool between curriculum, circulation and publishing, and as a 
device to aid weeding and shelving.. General and specific quidelines for 
classifying, including a method for resolving apparent duplication of courses 
in different departments are presented.. Time and unit figures are tabulated..
Specific steps in classification and editing are described..

Modernizing the University Library Structure
.A
Kaser, D.
.W
  Among the several kinds of change that appear to be in order in personnel
management in university libraries, some have been described, others have
not.  There has perhaps been a super-abundance of attention devoted, for
example, to the inadequate treatment of librarians within the university 
community as a whole, but little discussion has thus far appeared in print 
concerning their treatment within the library itself. This paper will attempt 
to define certain progressive changes that it is possible and probably 
desirable for the library to implement internally regardless of the university's
willingness to consider improving the librarian's lot in the larger community.

User's Reaction to Microfiche A Preliminary Study
.A
Lewis, Ralph W.
.W
   Recent emphasis placed on the use of microfiche  by large government agencies
has increased the pressure in libraries supporting government research to make
greater use of microfiche.. Negative and apathetic user attitudes, expressed by
researchers, indicate that expanded efforts to overcome resistance if the great 
potential of microfiche is to be realized.. Efforts in microphotography, 
expended on technical achievement in the past, should be directed toward
understanding the user and his needs to discover why he avoids microforms and
how to overcome his resistance to them..

Correlation the Subjects of Books Taken Out Of and Books Used Within an 
Open-Stack Library
.A
McGrath, William E.
.W
   The traditional over-the-counter circulation count is not always considered 
a reliable indicator of total library use.. To test this assumption the author
hypothesized that no correlation exists between the subjects of books taken out
of the library and those used within the library.. Counts were made of books 
left on tables, chairs, desks, and other surfaces and correlated to books 
charged out.. Two studies were made.. In the first, books were counted within 
finely delineated LC and Dewey class spans relating to academic departments..
In the second, books were counted within the broad LC first and second letters 
and the Dewey tens.. In the first case, the overall correlation was .86; in the
second, with less data, .84.. The author concludes that out-of-library 
circulation totals can be reliable indicators of in-library use.. For predicting
in-library use (and thus total use) two methods are cited-simple ratio of out 
to in, and the regression equation..

A Generalized Methodology for Library Systems Analysis
.A
Burns, R.W.
.W
  This article is directed toward the service in systems work.  Its purpose is 
to generalize at a very elementary level a methodology or approach which can be
used in conducting a systems study. Systems work is discussed here as a point
of view; a logical, coherent, from the top down, preface to decision-making
and resource allocation which utilizes a very powerful body of sophisticated
techniques.  The approach and techniques reviewed in this paper, however,
will be those on the most elementary  level.  No attempt will be made to
discuss the techniques of queueing, inventory management, linear programming,
simulation, marginal analysis, game theory, statistical inference, or any of
the other highly sophisticated techniques available to the operations 
research systems analysis (OR/SA) analyst. When the systems approach is clearly
understood and properly used, it becomes a potent weapon in the arsenal
of the administrator.  Rather than a review of the tools themselves, a
delineation of this systems methodology and point of view will be considered in 
this article.  The methodology discussed here embraces a number of standard 
techniques used by the systems engineer, time and motion analyst, operations 
researcher, and occasionally, even the librarian.

Cost Accounting and Analysis for University Libraries
.A
Leimkuhler, Ferdinand F.
Cooper, Michael D.
.W
   The approach to library planning studies in this paper is the use of 
accounting models to measure library costs and implement program budgets.. A 
cost-flow model for a university library is developed and tested with 
historical data from the General Library at the University of California,
Berkeley.. Various comparisons of an exploratory nature are made of the unit 
costs and total costs for different parts of the Berkeley system..

Change in Academic Libraries
.A
Haro, Robert P.
.W
Never noted for their willingness to accept innovative suggestions and 
implement change from outside sources, academic libraries have remained 
institutions in which changes in service policies and programs originated from 
internal sources only.. In order to shift to an orientation that seeks to 
develop new and expanding service programs, the establishment to research 
groups could do much to improve both the services offered by a library and its
role in the academic community.. While certain constraints always limit 
modification or the initiation of services, a properly constituted research 
group could do much to generate a climate for change, provide feedback to the 
library, and successfully continue to develop new and more effective library 
and information services..

Key Factors of Circulation System Analysis and Design
.A
McGee, Rob
.W
   Librarians must frequently judge circulation systems on the basis of widely 
disparate descriptions that make comparisons difficult.. A way is needed to 
place  various systems into a common perspective framework, so that their 
similarities and differences can be readily understood.. This paper explains 
basic (and largely familiar) concepts and components that are common to manual,
machine-aided, and computer-based systems, and documents their significance as 
key factors in the analysis and design of academic library circulation systems..
Cost factors are not discussed..

   A description of the methodology used in collecting performance data in a
large academic research library is given.. Twelve types of surveys used to 
measure and evaluate users, services, and materials were developed and 
conducted during the period 1968/69 at Columbia University libraries and later
evaluated.. Sample results are included.. Costs of providing research services
were found to be 64 percent versus 36 percent for instructional services..

Participative Management in Relation to Library Effectiveness
.A
Lynch, Beverly
.W
   This paper reviews a recent study on the influence of participative 
management on library performance.. Because most of the recent theoretical and 
empirical research being done in this area is ignored and an invalid measure of
participation in decision making is used, the study provides no basis for the
generalization that in increase in the library staff's participation in 
decision making will increase the library's effectiveness..

The Changing Role of Directors of University Libraries
.A
McAnally, Arthur M.
Downs, Robert B.
.W
   The role of the university library director has changed markedly in the last 
decade.. The position of library director has become a difficult role to serve..
Directors has been subjected to pressures from different quarters.. Five sources
are identified by the authors, including pressures from the president's office,
library stuff, faculty, and students.. These difficulties coupled with a 
declining ability to meet user needs, the lack of cohesive library planning, 
and an institutional inability to accommodate change have all contributed to the
declining status of the library director.. Recommendations as to ways to 
ameliorate the problem are offered.. Among the suggestions included are better
planning, improved budgeting techniques, and the introduction of new 
organizational patterns..

MacDonald, Robin W.
Elrod, J. Mcree

   A method of developing computer catalogs is proposed which does not require
unit card conversion but rather the accumulation of data from operating 
programs..  It is proposed that the bibliographic and finding functions of the
catalog be separated, with the latter being the first automated.. Such 
automation is seen as being advantageous on a cost basis..

Faculty Awareness and Attitudes Toward Academic Library Reference Services:
A Measure of Communication
.A
Nelson, Jerold
.W
   A survey of the faculties at six colleges was undertaken to measure the 
degree to which the libraries of those institutions were communicating with the
faculty concerning the availability of various references services.. The results
demonstrated that the average faculty member was aware of barely half the 
services actually available.. Variables of academic rank, length of teaching, 
and amount of library and reference use were some of the factors shown to 
affect faculty awareness of library service..

.A
Flener, Jane G.
.W
   A CLR Fellowship in 1971-72 enabled the author to examine staff participation
in the management of large academic libraries.. The report considers the climate
of participation, preparation given the staff, areas of decision making, the 
role of the professional staff association, and the reaction of staff to such 
participation..

Applying "Management by Objectives" To the University Library
.A
Johnson, Edward R.
.W
   Many methods of library management are no longer sufficient to meet the more
sophisticated demands of today.. A promising management technique for 
librarians is "managements by objectives", which helps to establish library 
goals, measure performance objectively, and to identify factors affecting an
operation's final results..

Reference-Bibliographers in the College Library
.A
Gration, Selby U.
Young, Arthur P.
.W
   One approach to making college library more relevant, dynamic, and 
intelligible is to employ specialists with broad subject competence, throughly
familiar with the terminology, bibliographic tools, and major writings of 
several related disciplines.. These subject specialists or reference-
bibliographers provide reference and institutional services, and serve as 
coordinators between academic departments and the library.. A significant 
increase in the quality of library service is attained with reference-
bibliographers both building and interpreting the collection.. The reference-
bibliographer concept is examined from several perspectives: historical
antecedents; relationship to the academic setting; and the authors' experience
with a staff of subject specialists at a predominantly undergraduate college
library during 1969-1972..

   The Management Review and Analysis Program (MRAP), designed, tested, and 
operated by the Association of Research Libraries' Office of University Library
Management Studies (OMS), is an assisted self-study strategy intended for use 
by large academic and research libraries.. The program assists libraries in 
reviewing and analyzing their current management policies and practices, and
provides guidelines for the application of contemporary principles of 
management for the improvement of library programs..

Allocating the Book Budget: A Model
.A
Kohut, Joseph J.
.W
   Inflation is currently affected library book budgets, particularly with 
respect to the acquisition of serials.. A model is proposed which would balance
the purchase of serials against the purchase of monographs by individual 
funding units within the academic library.. Special consideration is given to 
inflation as a cost factor affected by both the form of publication and the 
subject matter.. Applying the model to a specific example demonstrates its use 
in providing control over collection development and allowing for equitable 
distribution of book funds among funding units..

analysis.. A list of normative issues is derived from raising descriptive
questions about the politics of university libraries..

Providing Access to Externally Available Bibliographic Data Bases 
 in an Academic Library
.A
Hock, Randilph E.
.W
   The ready availability of externally processed bibliographic data based has 
made it possible for an academic library to provide computerized searches on a
large number of data bases with a very small initial investment and utilizing 
its own personnel.. The experience of the University of Pennsylvania Libraries 
has confirmed that such an approach is indeed feasible. This article discusses 
the approach, questions and problems encountered, and the factors considered in
their resolution.. Also discussed are the role of the data services librarian, 
the cost incurred, and some observations as to the philosophy of the approach, 
with particular attention to the integration of the service into the reference 
department..

The Coming Crisis of Western Sociology
.A
Gouldner, A.W.
.W
  The criticism and transformation of society can be divorced only
at our peril from the criticism and transformation of theories about
society.  Yet the gap between theory and practice, so common in the
history of American radical movements, is in some quarters growing
wider.  Some of the most militant of American radicals, in the
New Left or in the movement for Black liberation, have at least
temporarily avoided any serious concern with social theory.
  This neglect of theory doubtless has various origins.  In some
part it is due to the fact that these social movements are still new
and their political activism consumes their necessarily limited
energies and resources; the new radicalisms will, in short, need time
to produce their new theories.  Although the neglect of theory is
scarcely peculiar to Americans, it is in part also due to the fact
that American radicals are often more American than they know and
may prefer the tangible outcomes of pragmatic politics to the
intangible outputs of theory.  Again, part of their neglect of theoretical
problems is probably due to the close links that some young radicals
have with the "hippie" contingent of their generation, whose more
expressive and aesthetic styles of rejecting American culture
dispose them to avoid what they take to be the sterile "hassles" of
intellectual confrontation.  There is also a vocal minority who, as
has been said, feel personally excluded when they hear an appeal to
reason.

The SMART Automatic Document Retrieval System - An Illustration
.A
Salton, Gerard
Lesk, M.E.
.W
   A fully automatic document retrieval system operating on the IBM 7094 is 
described.. The system is characterized by the fact that several hundred
different  methods are available to analyze  documents and search requests..
This feature is used in the retrieval process by leaving the exact sequence of
operations initially unspecified, and adapting the search strategy to the needs
of individual users..
   The system is used not only to simulate an actual operating environment, but
also to test the effectiveness of the various available processing methods..
Results obtained so far seem to indicate that some combination of analysis 
procedures can in general be relied upon to retrieve the wanted information..
A typical search request is used as an example in the present  report to
illustrate systems operations  and evaluation procedures..

A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Banks
.A
Cod, E.F.
.W
  Future users of large data banks must be protected from having to know how 
the data is organized in the machine (the internal representation). A prompting
service which supplies such information is not a satisfactory solution.. 
Activities of users at terminals and most application programs should remain 
unaffected when the internal representation of data is changed
and even when some aspects of the external representation are changed.. Changes
in data representation will often be nedded as a result of changes in query, 
update, and report traffic and natural growth in the types of stored 
information.. 
  Existing noninferential, formated data systems provide users with tree-
structured files or slightly more general network models of the data.. In 
Section 1, inadequacies of these models are discussed.. A model based on n-ary
relations, a normal form for data base relations, and the concept of a universal
data sublanguage are introduced.. IN Section 2, certain operations (other than 
logical inference) are discussed and applied to the problems of redundancy and
consistency in the user's model..

Communication among Scientists and Engineers
.A
Lin, N.
Garvey, W.D.
Nelson, C.E.
.W
  Since 1966, the Johns Hopkins University Center for Research in Scientific
Communication has been conducting studies of the information flow process -
the production, dissemination, and assimilation of information - associated with
nine scientific and engineering disciplines.  This process in most disciplines
appears, from the dissemination point of view, to consume about five years -
from the time a scientist begins his research until reports of his findings are
cited in a review.  To date we have conducted over sixty studies of this process
and, since one of the main goals of our program is to make genuine comparisons
of the scientific communication associated with the disciplines being studied,
we have standardized the procedures, instruments, and analyses in those of the
major studies which were conducted for all disciplines.
  We will present findings from the major studies conducted to date in order
(1) to indicate the types of data we have collected on approximately 30,000
scientists and engineers during the past three years; (2) to indicate some of
the goals of our program; and (3) to suggest a preliminary picture of the
communication structure of science, as our program has led us to perceive it.

Communication of Innovations:  A Cross-Cultural Approach
.A
Rogers, E.M.
Shoemaker, F.F.
.W
  In the present edition we have, to a far greater extent, integrated diffusion
research with the scientific study of human communication.  Diffusion
researchers have long been aware that they were investigating a special type
of communication behavior.  In this book we stress communication concepts
and frameworks in our analysis of the diffusion process.  We feel this provides
an advantage of conceptual clarity as well as ease of wide expression.  Our
adoption of the communication viewpoint is reflected in the addition of
several chapters, the complete reorganization of all chapters, and the frequent
inclusion of new concepts.

Communication among Scientists and Engineers
.A
Nelson, C. E.
.W
   In the course of collecting data on nine scientific and technological
disciplines, it has become obvious to us that in their communication 
activities, some disciplines behave quite differently from others.. Recently,
we have reanalyzed our data for the physical, the engineering, and the social
sciences.. We do not have time to discuss differences among all three groups,
so we have decided to compare only the physical and social sciences.. We have
included data pertaining to the engineering sciences on the graphs, however,
so you can get some idea of how they differ from the other two groups..
   Before discussing these differences, we should like to emphasize that there
are similarities, that there are of major importance, and that they, in fact,
make genuine comparisons among the groups feasible..
   We will discuss differences between the physical and the social sciences in
terms of three major communication characteristics associated with science..

Citation Measures of Hard Science, Soft Science, Technology and Nonscience
.A
de Solla Price, D.
.W
  Perhaps the fundamental problem of those that work in the scientific
information industry is that it is not just that special part of an information
industry that happens to deal with material having a scientific content.  
Technical librarianship involves much more than librarianship applied to 
books with an esoteric vocabulary and much mathematics.
  My reason for choosing this problem as a contribution for such a strategic
conference is that I know well as an historian of science that the greatest and
most useful advances in our technologies have not come from the applied
research of trained people trying to make themselves useful to society, but
rather from basic research aimed at furthering understanding and curiousity,
and powered by the latest instrumentation that the useful people have devised.
I suspect that all the new indexing tools and computer handlings will be more
useful to basic research in understanding scientists than they will to
solving practical problems for which they are designed.  It seems clear,
however, that it is only such new understanding that can bring success,
whatever solutions ultimately emerge.

Natural Language Question - Answering System: 1969
.A
Simmons, Robert F.
.W
   Recent experiments in programming natural language question-answering system
are reviewed to summarize the methods that have been developed for syntactic, 
semantic, and logical analysis of English strings.. It is concluded that at
least minimally effective  techniques have been devised for answering questions
from natural language subsets in small scale experimental systems and that a 
useful paradigm has evolved to guide research efforts in the field.. Current 
approaches to semantic analysis and logical inference are seen to be effective 
beginnings but of questionable generality with respect either to subtle aspects
of meaning or to applications over large subset of English.. Generalizing from
current small-scale experiments to language processing systems based on 
dictionaries with thousands of entries - with correspondingly large grammars 
and semantic systems - may entail a new order of complexity and require the 
invention and development of entirely different approaches to semantic analysis 
and question answering..

Inefficiency of the Use of Boolean Functions for Information Retrieval Systems
.A
Verhoeff, J.
Goffman, W.
Belzer, J.
.W
  In this note we attempt to point out why boolean functions
are, in general, not applicable in information retrieval
systems.
  First, we wish to stress that a system, which supposedly
is to serve a certain purpose, has to try to optimize some
overall performance rather than certain detailed parts of
it.  This situation is, of course, well known. 
  Saying that a system should cater to an optimal performance
implies that the reward varies with different circumstances.
That is, there may always be some customers who will not agree
that the system's output is satisfactory.  However, these
should be relatively few.  In the case of an information
retrieval system, let us consider one whose function is to
furnish a reference list as a reaction to a question.  
So, if we have a set of documents S and a set of questions
Q, the system has to assign to each question q, an answer A(q)
which is a subset of S.  Naturally, this answer cannot be
chosen arbitrarily; it should reflect a relation between
the question and the resulting reference list.  Usually
one says that the documents in the list are relevant to
the question.  More precisely stated, we assume that the
enquirer expects a certain reference list, namely the one
he would have procured had he himself probed the documents
in the set.

The Teachable Language Comprehender:
A Simulation Program and Theory of Language
.A
Quillian, M.R.
.W
  The Teachable Language Comprehender (TLC) is a program
designed to be capable of being taught to "comprehend"
English text.  When text which the program has not seen before
is input to it, it comprehends that text by correctly relating
each (explicit or implicit) assertion of the new text to a large
memory.  This memory is a "semantic network" representing
factual assertions about the world.
  The program also creates copies of the parts of its memory
which have been found to relate to the new text, adapting
and combining these copies to represent the meaning of the
new text.  By this means, the meaning of all text the program
successfully comprehends is encoded into the same format as
that of the memory.  In this form it can be added into the
memory.
  Both factual assertions for the memory and the capabilities
for correctly relating text to the memory's prior content are to
be taught to the program as they are needed.  TLC presently
contains a relatively small number of examples of such
assertions and capabilities, but within the system, notations for
expressing either of these are provided.  Thus the program
now corresponds to a general process for comprehending
language, and it provides a methodology for adding the
additional information this process requires to actually
comprehend text of any particular kind.
  The memory structure and comprehension process of TLC
allow new factual assertions and capabilities for relating
text to such stored assertions and capabilities for relating
text to such stored assertions to generalize automatically.
That is, once such an assertion or capability is put into the
system, it becomes available to help comprehend a great many
other sentences in the future.

An Information-Theoretic Approach to Text Searching
in Direct Access Systems
.A
Barton, I.J.
Creasey, S.E.
Lynch, M.F.
Snell, M.J.
.W
  Using direct access computer files of bibliographic
information, an attempt is made to overcome one of the
problems often associated with information retrieval,
namely, the maintenance and use of large dictionaries,
the greater part of which is used only infrequently.
A novel method is presented, which maps they hyperbolic
frequency distribution of text characteristics onto a
rectangular distribution.  This is more suited to 
implementation on storage devices.
  This method treats text as a string of characters
rather than words bounded by spaces, and chooses subsets
of strings such that their frequencies of occurrence are
more even than those of word types.  The members of this
subset are then used as index keys for retrieval.  The
rectangular distribution of key frequencies results in a much
simplified file organization and promises considerable
cost advantages.

The Community College Library
.A
Veit, F.
.W
  This study deals with the learning resources programs of the public
two-year colleges.  In former years, these institutions were commonly
called junior colleges, and the college departments or divisions that
assembled, organized, and interpreted the learning resources (mainly
books) were commonly called libraries.  In keeping with traditional
terminology I could have chosen "The Junior College Library" as the
title for the study; however, I decided to modify the title to make it
correspond more closely to prevailing current terminology.

Comparative and International Librarianship; essays on themes and problems
.A
Jackson, M.M.
.W
  In this decade, professionals in the field of librarianship and the
information sciences will continue to be faced with most of the
problems that have haunted libraries for generations, problems that
can be best summed up as the attempt to reduce the anonymity of
information.  There will also be many new problems.  Some of these
are already becoming apparent, while others are still unknown.  But
librarians need not despair; the past record is clear.  Through the use
of sophisticated electronic machines, we have begun to master the
bibliographical control and retrieval of information, we have
improved the communication between librarians and the consumers
of information on a national and international basis, and we have
refined the many problems concerned with cataloging and classifying
information.  In addition, library education has been on the front
line in trying to educate people to understand the complexities of
organizing and disseminating information of all types.

Computational Analysis of Present-Day American English
.A
Kucera, H.
.W
  Readers can expect to find many parts of this volume tantalizing.  The 
definiteness of the answers to certain questions irresistibly provokes more 
questions.  The happy feature is that the book provides information required 
to limit the effect to that of tantalizing rather than frustrating. For there 
is given here a wholly adequate description of the nature of the Corpus of
Present-Day Edited American English on which this study is based, the details 
of its constituents, and the modes of its transfer to tape.  A replica of that 
tape is available at a small cost in money, which is minuscule compared to the 
cost in time needed to produce a like corpus.  Accordingly, any reader who 
seriously wants answers to further questions can set about getting those 
answers.

Computer-Based Library and Information Systems
.A
Henley, J.P.
.W
  This book describes some of the various ways in which a computer
could be used as part of a library system.  In doing so, it aims to bridge
the gap between librarian and computer specialist, by introducing
computers to those involved in library work, especially students of
librarianship, and at the same time helping to make those interested
in the computer applications field aware of the potential and problems
of the library environment.

Computer Filing of Index Bibliographic and Catalog Entries
.A
Hines, T.C.
.W
  The need to establish a filing code for computer arrangement
has become increasingly apparent as more and more book
catalogs and indexes have been prepared mechanically.  Many
of the difficulties in manual filing, as shown in the A.L.A. Rules
for Filing Catalog Cards, become even more intricate to cope
with when computers are used.  Of course, if cost is not an
object, the theoretical potentialities for computer programming are
practically limitless.  However, modifications in rules and procedures
can make the alphabetic arranging or merging of index, catalog,
or bibliographic entries by computer more readily possible, and
these modifications are made in this proposed code for computer
filing of complex alphabetic entries.

Computer Handling of Chemical Structure Information
.A
Lynch, M.F.
.W
  Far-reaching changes in the patterns of communication in science
are at present in motion, which seem likely to have fundamental
effects on scientists's use of and access to existing knowledge.
These changes derive from the increasing involvement of computer
techniques in the publication, dissemination and retrieval of scientific
and technical information.  Many of the implications of the changes
are not yet clear.  Information-handling is rapidly changing from a
labour-intensive industry to a capital-intensive one, as soaring
man-power requirements reflect the increasing flow of information and
increasing demands for timeliness, accuracy, and improved access.
But the changes to be effected also have major social implications;
the reasons for publication and use of information are complex,
reflecting the factors of a sociological nature which are still 
imperfectly understood.  The rate at which innovations in information-
handling win acceptance from scientists is determined partly by their
appreciation of the greater flexibility which the novel methods offer,
but also by the sensitivity, on the part of the designers and operators
of information systems, to the needs and habits of users, and to their
perception of the usefulness of the newer methods.

Current approaches to classification and clump-finding at the Cambridge
Language Research Unit
.A
Sparck-Jones, K.
Jackson, David
.W
   Computer programs for automatic classification are a desideratum in many 
fields.. Work on suitable procedures for handling large bodies of object/
property descriptions has been in progress at the Cambridge Language Research
Unit for some years: this paper describes the current series of general-purpose
programs which have been developed there, in which classes or "clamps" of
objects are obtained, using a similarity matrix, by a simple iterative scan of 
the universe of objects, distributing them in such a way that an appropriate 
cohesion function is minimized.. This actual clump-finding process is embedded
in a overall package in which the information given by a classification is 
manipulated in a variety of ways.. The current applications of the programs, 
especially for information retrieval, are described..

The identification of variable-length, equifrequent character strings in a
natural language data base
.A
Clare, A.C.
Cook, Elizabeth M.
Lynch, M.F.
.W
   The words of natural language texts exhibit a Poisson (or Zipfian) rank-
frequency relationship, i.e., a small number of common words accounts for a 
large proportion of word occurrences, while a large number of the words occur 
as singletons or only infrequently.. Inverted-file retrieval systems using free
text data bases commonly identify words as the keys or index terms about which 
the file is inverted, and through which access is provided.. They therefore 
involve large and growing dictionaries and many entail inefficient utilization
of storage because of the distribution characteristics..
   An alternative approach may be based on the analysis of text in terms of
sets of variable-length character strings, the frequency distributions of
which are much less disparate than those of words.. This could lead to 
substantial reductions in dictionary size, and increased efficiency both in 
dictionary look-up times and storage utilization.

.A
Williams, M.E.
.W
  This document, Computer Readable Bibliographic Data Bases -- A Directory
and Data Sourcebook not only updates the 1973 publication, which included 
information on 81 data bases, but expands the coverage to 300 data bases and 
includes considerably more information about the data bases.
  Methodology used to obtain data involved:  (1) consulting published and
unpublished sources; (2) design of a 13 page questionnaire; (3) mail survey;
and (4) telephone follow up and verification.  The sources consulted were
(1) the Survey of Commercially Available Computer-Readable Bibliographic
Data Bases; (2) M.E. Williams' personal data base files which include
information from the open literature, news releases, and personal contacts;
(3) NEWSIDIC, April 1975 issue number 16, the quarterly newsletter produced
by EUSIDIC which included a survey of computer readable bibliographic files;
(4) the "World Inventory of Abstracting and Indexing Services--Data Elements
Definition List;" and (5) the ASIDIC Survey of Information Center Services.

Computerized Library Catalogs: Their Growth, Cost and Utility
.A
Dolby, J.L.
.W
  This book is a slightly modified form of a report on computerized
library catalogs prepared for the Office of Education of the United States
Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (Contract OEC-1-7-
071182-5013).  It consists of seven chapters.  The first poses the problems
that have been studied, introduces background material to facilitate an
understanding of their significance, and presents our conclusions and
general recommendations.  The remaining chapters belong to one of two
parts, depending on whether their principle concern is the utility or the
cost of computeerized library catalogs.  Because the problem of utility is the
more speculative of the two, it has been placed in the second part.

The Concept of Main Entry as Represented in the Anglo-American Cataloging Rules
.A
Hamdy, M.N.
.W
  The work published here is rather like those conclusive statements
of renaissance science that located the soul not in the human frame but
in the human spirit.  The author of this work may face the wrath of the
medievalists among our fellow professional catalogers.  At the least, the
publication of this book should encourage a complete reappraisal of our
cataloging methods, because the difference between title unit entry and
author-equivalent unit entry, a confabulation of main and unit entry
arising from tradition rather than practicality, can be clearly seen not 
only in the job classifications and job descriptions of cataloging
departments, but also in our philosophy of librarianship.

Concepts and Subject Headings

Christ, J.M.
.W
        Librarians are known for their organizational work
with recorded knowledge.  Information storage and retrieval
are two well-known, basic functions associated with this
work.  A search of the literature of library science reveals
that these functions have not been examined to any significant
degree from the users' point of view.  This is true in regard
to library catalogs and library subject headings.

Conceptual Basis of the Classification of Knowledge
.A
Wojciechowski, J.A.
.W
  As far as philosophers are concerned, the Conference seems to be justified
precisely because of the present state of the Classification of Knowledge.  For
two thousand years, the Classification of Knowledge has been a major
philosophical problem.  Lately, it has evolved from a philosophical
preoccupation into a specialized technique, a species of the general techniques 
of classification, far removed from philosophical preoccupations and equally
ignored by philosophers.  At the present time there exist powerful technical
models of classification and highly developed classifications of various
branches of knowledge.  What is lacking is a satisfactory general
classification of knowledge and an adequate clarification of the philosophical
problems underlying such classification.  The need for clarification is
important from the theoretical as well as practical point of view because
the general systems of classification of knowledge depend on theories of
knowledge.  It is therefore highly desirable that philosophers and specialists
in classification get together and discuss problems of common interest.

Conceptual Design of an Automated National Library System
.A
Meise, N.R.
.W
    This work describes a conceptual design of an automated
national library system.  The design is "conceptual" in that it is
intended to show the feasibility of a system concept rather than
provide a detailed engineering design.  The design concerns an
automated national library system but does not attempt to automate
all parts of the system.  It is primarily concerned with the functions of
bibliographic searching, acquisition, circulation, and cataloging.  If
these functions can be economically automated, the major problems
associated with our information explosion will be solved.

Continuing Library and Information Science Education
.A
Stone, E.W.
.W
  This report and its recommendations are in response to the Commission's
request for "a nationwide program of continuing education for personnel in
the library and information science field."  While it is offered as only the
start of an on-going process of developing a nationwide program, its
recommendations are the result of an intensive nine-month project, involving
hundreds of persons in the library and information science fields.
  Many of these persons participated in mini-charettes, in a written survey,
or in personal interviews which addressed major issues such as: certification;
organizational and individual incentives for continuing education; educational
methods; and continuing education needs.  The contribution of these library
personnel cannot be overstated. Their collective wisdom and perspective
have led the Project team to many of its major recommendations.  However,
as would be expected when such a large number of people are involved,
there were differences of opinion, even as there are many differences of
opinion reflected in the literature of continuing education emanating from
the various professions.  In the present study, most of these differences
related to the input into and control over the policies of the national
structure.  Three alternative models which have been considered are outlined
in Appendix D; alternatives to several specific features of the recommended
model are presented at the end of Chapter 4.  Throughout the text, when issues
are presented on which there is uncertainty because of the intensity of
opinions expressed, these areas are identified.

Cooperation Between Types of Libraries
.A
Stenstrom, R.H.
.W
  This bibliography uses the traditional typology of libraries as its
starting point - public, school, academic-research, and special libraries.
This classification is most commonly used and provides a sufficiently clear
distinction for the purposes of this work.
  Public libraries are those which are free to all residents of the library's
district and supported primarily from general public funds or taxes levied
for library purposes.  Local public libraries, systems of public libraries,
and state library agencies are included in this category.
  School libraries are those maintained by the governing boards of
schools whether they be public, private, or parochial.  School libraries
at the elementary, junior high school, and senior high school level are
included.
  Academic-research libraries include the libraries of institutions of
higher education, both public and private, as well as libraries which,
while they might be defined as either public or special, are widely known
for their research resources.  Junior college libraries, college libraries,
university libraries, and technical school libraries are included as
academic libraries.  The Library of Congress, the Newberry Library, and 
Linda Hall Library are examples of nonacademic research libraries.
  Special libraries are those directed toward making information available
to people within a particular organization with fairly well-defined
information needs.  Business and industrial libraries and the libraries of
nonprofit organizations are common examples.
  While distinctions between research and special libraries are not
always easily made, it is felt that in the case of this bibliography, no
serious problems are created.

Copying Methods Manual
.A
Hawken, N.R.
.W
  The current need for a manual of copying methods dealing with the processes, 
methods, techniques, and types of equipment which can be used for reproducing 
documents of a great many different kinds arises from two factors:
  (1) The great importance of document reproduction processes in the 
acquisition, preservation, dissemination, and communication of information
vital to the conduct of research work in all fields of human endeavor and on an 
international scale.
  (2) The complexity of the field of document reproduction today which has 
resulted from the enormous technical advances made in the past fifteen years.
  The need for the coining of the new class word - reprography (an unfortunate
graft of a Latin fragment on a Greek root) - is in itself indicative of the 
great changes that have come about.  Processes and methods which formerly were 
discrete and distinctive have now become intricately interrelated. New processes
and combinations of processes with different and astonishing capabilities
continue to appear.  This revolution in the document copying field has been 
powerfully augmented by intensive competition on the part of manufacturers for 
a share of the vast and lucrative office-records copying field.  The results, 
however, have led to highly important applications in the reproduction of 
research materials as well.

Corporate Headings:  Their use in library cataloguing and
national bibliographics:  A comparative and critical study 
.A
Verona, E.
.W
  This study is an attempt to submit to a critical analysis the
main problems related to corporate headings, the difficulties
raised by them and the solutions which now prevail in various
countries.
  In order to make the differences existing between the various
solutions and the unsatisfactory character revealed by many of
them more evident, a great number of examples in a variety of
languages, extracted from cataloguing codes, national bibliographies, 
printed lists of corporate headings have been added.  These examples
are also intended to draw attention to differences existing with
regard to various technical details, such as punctuation, 
capitalization, transliteration, etc.
  In addition, many of these examples will clearly prove that
certain solutions which may be considered to be suitable for one
country or one language would not satisfy the requirements of
another country or another language.
  In the study, examination and analysis of codes has been 
complemented by references to professional literature on the subject
available to the author, and by an analysis of opinions expressed
there.  Special attention has been paid to comparisons of cataloguing
practices and citation usages, and to investigations of the users'
approach to corporate headings.  It is well understood and appreciated
that, for the catalogue user, the identification of and search for
corporate headings present more problems than any other type of
heading.  Unfortunately, however, professional literature has as
yet paid insufficient attention to these problems.

A Criticism and the Growth of Knowledge
.A
Kuhn, T.J.
.W
  On almost all the occasions when we turn explicitly to the same problems,
Sir Karl's view of science and my own are very nearly identical.  We
are both concerned with the dynamic process by which scientific knowledge
is acquired rather than with the logical structure of the products of
scientific research.  Given that concern, both of us emphasize, as legitimate  
data the facts and also the spirit of actual scientific life, and both of us
turn often to history to find them.  From this pool of shared data, we draw
many of the same conclusions.  Both of us reject the view that science
progresses by accretion; both emphasize instead the revolutionary process by
which an older theory is rejected and replaced by an incompatible new one;
and both deeply underscore the role played in this process by the older
theory's occasional failure to meet challenges posed by logic, experiment,
or observation.  Finally, Sir Karl and I are united in opposition to a number
of classical positivism's most characteristic theses.  We both emphasize, for
example, the intimate and inevitable entanglement of scientific observation
with scientific theory; we are correspondingly sceptical of efforts to
produce any neutral observation language; and we both insist that scientists
may properly aim to invent theories that explain observed phenomena and
that do so in terms of real objects, whatever the latter phrase may mean.

  Information, whose handling is the topic of this book, is
generated by change, and whatever is our unit of change is our unit of
information.  In a situation in which only three possible moves can
be made, only three fundamental units of information can be found,
no matter how complex a structure we may build upon them.  Our
topic is therefore a special sort of change, the change brought about
in acquiring or keeping or transmitting elements of knowledge.

CAS computer-Based Information Services
.A
Davenport, W.C.
.W
  This paper describes the key points that characterize
CAS' approach to large scale scientific-technical information
systems that must handle over 100,000 documents per year.
The first of these points is the "single analysis/multiple
use" concept.  Intellectual ability is a rare commodity 
and essential to an information service.  Therefore, it makes
sense to conserve that commodity and not use manpower to
perform repetitive jobs or to waste effort analyzing information.

A Regional Network - Ohio college Library Center
.A
Kilgour, F.G.
.W
  The Ohio College Library Center is developing
a computerized, user-oriented, library system
that will improve efficiency of library use and
operations; that will increase availability of
library resources within a region; and that will facilitate
evolution of new and easier accesses to information in
libraries.  The center does not conceive of its task as being
merely the mechanization of library procedures of the past.
  For the immediate future, the principal academic objective
of the center is to increase the availability of library
resources for use in educational and research programs in
colleges and universities throughout Ohio.  A more distant
objective is to enable libraries to participate actively in the
programs of instruction and research in their institutions.
The passive service functions that libraries have developed
during the past century are proving inadequate to meet the
present demands made of libraries, and will be increasingly
inadequate in the future.
  The per-student costs of libraries are rising somewhat
more than twice as rapidly as unit-cost rises in the general
economy.  Therefore, the principal economic goal of the
Ohio College Library Center is to decelerate the rate of rise
of per-student costs, so that the rate of increase will
approximate that of the economy as a whole.

Decision Analysis:  Introductory Lectures on Choices Under Uncertainty
.A
Raiffa, H.
.W
  These lectures do not present a descriptive theory of actual behavior.
Neither do they present a positive theory of behavior for a superintelligent,
fictitious being; nowhere in our analysis shall we refer to the behavior of an
"idealized, rational, and economic man," a man who always acts in a perfectly
consistent manner as if somehow there were embedded in his nature a coherent
set of evaluation patterns that cover any and all eventualities.  Rather, the
approach we take prescribes how an individual who is faced with a problem of
choice under uncertainty should go about choosing a course of action that is
consistent with his personal basic judgements and preferences.  He must
consciously police the consistency of his subjective inputs and calculate
their implications for action.  Such an approach is designed to help us reason
and act a bit more systematically - when we choose to do so!

The Design of Inquiring Systems
.A
Churchman, C.W.
.W
  "Design" is used throughout in its most generic sense,
to include planning, operations research, engineering design,
architectural design, programming, budgeting, and all the other
activities in which we consciously attempt to change ourselves and our
environment to improve the quality of our lives.  So the book could be
read as a philosophy of organization theory, or of architectural or
engineering design, or of operations research, or of planning.
  The word "inquiry" suggests that the audience includes persons
interested in the philosophy of science; this is true, so long as the
interest is a very broad one, concerned with the meaning of science with
respect to other social institutions, health, education, morality, and so
on.  Inquiry is by no means restricted to the disciplines of science.  I
could have called the book The Design of Systems, but this would not
adequately reflect my style, which is to proceed from the more specific
problem of inquiry to the "whole system."

Deterioration and Preservation of Library Materials
.A
Winger, H.W.
.W
  The deterioration of library materials, constant since libraries began, has
accelerated to alarming proportions in 1969.  Researchers have predicted that
all paper-based records of this century, as well as those of earlier years,face
imminent ruin.  Without new and effective efforts for their preservation, most
will not be usable in their present form in the next century.  The danger of
destruction threatens not only research library collections but also the world
of knowledge and scholarship that they support. For not only paper is involved.
Similar dangers of destruction confront other cellulosic products, such as
film, which may substitute for paper as the material base of records.  And not
only research libraries are involved. The surprisingly rapid deterioration of
printed materials, even those that have been produced with some eye to 
permanence, creates problems and expenses for other libraries as well.

Developing Multi-Media Libraries
.A
Hicks, W.B.
.W
  This book presents the concept of the modern library as a comprehensive
resource center.  The philosophy and objectives of the center are clarified,
and desirable practices in the selection and acquisition of nonbook or
audiovisual materials - interchangeably defined as those materials that 
communicate primarily through aural and visual stimuli - are recommended,
along with information pertinent to facilitating these tasks.  Their 
organization in general in discussed, with emphasis on the necessity for
basic decisions and policies.  Cataloging and physical processing are treated
in particular, demonstrating that accepted library practices can be flexible
enough to allow adaptation for both the individual library and its specific
clientele.  Realistic methods of handling the many different kinds of nonbook
materials are demonstrated by treating each type separately.  Many easy-to-
follow cataloging examples are presented; and, consistent with established
library routine, practical information is provided on selection, acquisition,
physical processing, storage, and equipment.  Work-flow charts are included
to present a graphic demonstration of efficient procedures.

The Development of Reference Services through Academic Traditions,
Public Library Practice and Special Librarianship
.A
Rothstein, S.
.W
  Modern American library history has received only sporadic attention as a
subject for investigation.  Though we have now accumulated an adequate supply
of source materials to draw upon in the form of annual reports, service 
studies, biographical accounts, and chronicles of individual libraries,
no one has yet fashioned out of these materials a critical history of American
librarianship.  To paraphrase Leo LaMontagne, we have salvaged remnants from
the past, but we have yet to convert them into history.
  The lack has cost the profession dearly.  Even a casual survey of the
literature of librarianship reveals the shocking degree of duplication and
naivete that stem from an insufficient awareness of previous efforts.
  There is clearly room and need for a series of evaluative studies of the 
development of American library services which could eventually be put
together to form the desired definitive history of American librarianship.
The present dissertation is intended as a contribution toward that end.  It
undertakes to furnish the historical background for one of the continuing
problems of American librarianship - the provision of reference services in
research libraries.

Dewey Decimal Classification
.A
Dewey, M.
.W
  The schedules of Edition 18, like those of 17, are based on the
principle of subject integrity.  Both the subject matter and the notation are
hierarchical, so that what is true of a given whole is true of all its parts.
The schedules are developed according to logical principles, so that the
classifier is guided to make correct decisions.  The terminology of the
classification scheme reflects the terminology used by the literature
being classified.
  For ease of use, this edition includes many more example notes, more detailed
and precise instructions, and freer use of layman's terminology than did its
immediate predecessor.
  Since this edition is intended for use as a shelf-arrangement system for
general libraries of all sizes, its fulness is based upon the number of titles
that large libraries may be expected to acquire in various fields.  Since
it is also intended for use in classified catalogs and bibliographies (for
which the Dewey Decimal Classification is increasingly in demand in many
countries), it contains an increased number of provisions for number building.

Diffusion of Abstract and Indexing Services for Government - Sponsored Research

Klempner, I.M.
.W
  During the last several decades, science and technology have
undergone a drastic transformation.  The enormity and depth of this
transformation can be measured in many ways.  It can be measured
in terms of the number of students enrolled in graduate and
undergraduate schools offering degrees in the physical and applied
sciences, in terms of the number of new devices, products and
innovations introduced into the military establishment and into the 
civilian sector of our economy, in terms of the number of scientists and
engineers employed by industry and public and private institutions,
in terms of the amounts of money expended annually on research
and development, in terms of the number of technical reports, books,
journals, papers, reprints, and conference proceedings stemming
from these expenditures, and in many other ways.

Diffusion of Innovations
.A
Rogers, E.
.W
  This book is directed both to advanced college students
enrolled in sociology courses and to students of the other
social sciences (such as anthropology, economics, history,
and psychology) who are concerned with diffusion.  (For this 
reason, sociological concepts are defined when they are
introduced.)
  More than five hundred publications on the diffusion of
innovations are reviewed here.  The innovations studied range
from new drugs among physicians to hand tools among primitive
tribes, and from driver training among public high 
schools to hybrid corn among farmers.  Although a generally
consistent set of findings has emerged from these studies, a
search of the literature shows little attempt to summarize and
evaluate available results and theories on the spread of ideas.
This volume synthesizes these findings and theories.

Directory of Data Base in the Social and Behavioral Sciences
.A
Sessions, V.S.
.W
  As one of the early members of the computer community, I have
been keenly interested in the development of quantitative methodologies
in the social and behavioral sciences, and their encouragement
by the data processing environment.  The economists, with an already
established mathematical orientation, were among the earliest beneficiaries
of the machine technology that enhances their ability to
construct the test models of economic behavior.  Today, statistical
methods have so affected many disciplines that it is not unusual for
doctoral programs to accept statistical techniques as a substitute for
one foreign language.  Similarly, the ability to program in an
appropriate language is also frequently as acceptable as French or
German in providing the research skills needed by doctoral students at
The City University of New York and at other universities.
  The chief function of this directory, in terms of academic supplies
of data, is not to reinventory the social science data archives
that are well-known to the academic community, not to duplicate the
announcements of holdings that they themselves make available to their
members.  The reason for mentioning them and indicating the nature of
their holdings is to make this kind of data resource known to those
researchers, either in or out of the university, who are not sufficiently
aware of these important resources.

The Disadvantaged and Library Effectiveness
.A
Lipsman, c.K.
.W
    The report is concerned with the social utility of libraries and
with the factors that appear to be requirements for effective
programs.  In the absence of established standards or criteria for
measuring program effectiveness, we have substituted a comparative analysis of
a number of programs based on detailed observation of the program process;
a survey of needs and interests of the
target groups, both users and nonusers; and an assessment of the
library's role in the target neighborhood as it is perceived by other
community institutions serving the same groups.  Thus a basis for
comparisons and for judgements has been introduced which provides
a foundation for suggestions as to the direction in which programs
of service to the disadvantaged might move.
  To achieve the study objectives, library programs and practices
in low-income neighborhoods were examined in a number of cities.
In each of fifteen cities data were collected through interview and
observation in four subject areas: (1) the needs and interests of
the community residents, (2) library services in relation to other
available community resources, (3) the nature and scope of the
neighborhood library program and its relation to the rest of the
library system, and (4) available measures of the impact or
effectiveness of the program.

  More than half a century ago La Fontaine and Otlet started
their lives' work, which at first was connected with the term
"bibliography," but to which gradually the work "Documentation"
was attributed.  What they developed was of a far wider scope
than the establishment of a new technique dealing with printed
and non-printed documents.
  The great deal which inspired them, and those who worked
side by side with them, was to render accessible the totality of
what is crystallized from human thought and to make of it a
common treasure of mankind, serving to bring mutual comprehension
and to build for peace by the co-operation of all men of goodwill
of all nations.
  It was in this spirit that my friend Bradford joined those men,
whose noble faces have passed and to whom it never was given to
see the achievement of the work to which they devoted their lives.
  And it was in this spirit that Bradford, thanks to his knowledge
and experience as scientist as well as librarian, not only
gave his strong and valuable support to the common work but
added to it fundamental and constructive new elements.
  Just for this reason the present book we owe to him gives far
more than a mere compilation of facts and experiences.  Such
a compilation would indeed be welcome because, curiously
enough, up to now, there is no good general treatise on
documentation available.  But his book gives us before all things
an abundance of original ideas and creative thoughts.

  The current need for a manual of copying methods dealing with the processes, 
methods, techniques, and types of equipment which can be used for reproducing 
documents of a great many different kinds arises from two factors: 
  (1) The great importance of document reproduction processes in the 
acquisition, preservation, dissemination, and communication of information vital
to the conduct of research work in all fields of human endeavor and on an
international scale.
  (2) The complexity of the field of document reproduction today which has 
resulted from the enormous technical advances made in the past fifteen years.

  Since the first publication of this work Dr. Bradford has
died, and, a further edition now being called for, an attempt
has been made to recognize if not to deal with some criticisms
expressed on the first edition.
  The principal one was that whereas the book was entitled
"Documentation" it dealt in the main with the Universal
Decimal Classification, which Bradford did much to develop,
but that it neglected other aspects and instruments of the
subject of which the UDC is only one, even if an important
one, of various techniques.

Dynamic Information and Library Processing
.A
Salton, G.
.W
  Among the various information processing tasks which may be carried
out with computing equipment, a special class exists for which the term
information takes on the literal and direct sense of recorded knowledge, or
intelligence.  The elements being transformed are then no longer restricted
to mathematical symbols alone, but they may be words and phrases, books,
documents, pictures, and other information carriers.  It is that more
restricted interpretation of an information process which gives rise to the 
field of information science, concerned with the collection, analysis,
classification, storage, retrieval, transmission, and dissemination of
recorded data and intelligence.

Economic Analysis of the Public Libraries
.A
Newhouse, J.P.
.W
  This study addresses itself to several questions important to all public
libraries.  How should the library allocate its book budget?  What kinds of
books should it tend to buy?  What types of households use the library?  Why
do some households not use the library?  What is the cost of the various
services provided by the library?  What specific steps can the library take
to improve its services?  What are the library's options in choosing among the
different circulation systems?  For how long should the library allow books to
be checked out?  How frequently should overdue notices be sent out?  Is an
investment in a security system worthwhile?
  We have studied these questions in the context of one public library - the
Beverly Hills (California) Public Library - and have developed a methodology
for determining answers to them, as well as to other questions that arose
during our investigation.  Although answers will vary from library to library,
our methodology is quite general and should prove useful at many public 
libraries.

Economics of the Academic Libraries
.A 
Baumol, W.J.
.W
  This volume represents what we believe to be as complete
and thorough an analysis as possible of the available economic
data on college and university libraries.  In the course
of our study, we have examined the data for comprehensiveness
and consistency; we have investigated their intertemporal
behavior, both as a basis for projection and as an
instrument for long-range planning; and we have constructed
a set of analytic interrelationships which permit us to derive
statistical estimates of the interrelations of some of the most
critical economic variables relating to library operations.  In
particular, in the course of this last step, we have provided
relationships explaining statistically the determination of
such variables as the size of libraries' budgets and the
magnitude of their professional staffs.

Economics of Approval Plans
.A
Spyersduran, P.
.W
  Current budget strains on college and university libraries
require a stepped-up search for operating economies.  The
timely topic of economics of approval plans of the Third
International Conference on Approval and Gathering Plans
for Large and Medium Size Academic Libraries, held at the
Ramada Inn, West Palm Beach, Florida, February 17-19,
1971, has thus generated considerable interest.
  The papers published here constitute, by and large, original
research in this area.  The importance of these contributions
can hardly be overestimated, since they will no doubt mold
and influence collection development practices in the current
imprint area.

Economics of Book Storage
.A
Ellsworth, R.E.
.W
  This report attempts to present and interpret current
(Winter 1968-69) information on the economics of book storage
in relation to the other factors a university administrator
must consider in developing a program for housing an
ever-growing book collection when there are present or
future limitations on space and money.
  The study will attempt to answer two specific questions:
1) Is it economical for colleges and universities to select
so-called little-used books from the regular bookstacks and
store them elsewhere? 2) Is the cost factor the only one a
university need consider in adopting a storage program; and,
if not, how is cost related to the others?
  The facts and conclusions in this report are based on
the library book storage situation as of 1969.  Innovations
in computer applications and other technologies could
presumably change the nature of some of the cost factors, but
it is the author's opinion that these changes unlikely to
occur within the next 5 to 10 years.

Economies and Computers
.A
Sharpe, W.F.
.W
  It is not a simple matter to describe this book.  Briefly, it
attempts to provide and apply a set of concepts from economic theory
that may prove valuable to those who are now or may become decision-
makers in the selection, financing, and/or use of computers.  Only
theory relevant for such decision-makers is presented here.  This means
that the effects of computers on the economy as a whole lie outside
the scope of this book, as do a number of related issues.  We deal,
thus, with microeconomic, not macroeconomic, theory: our focus is on the
small (industry, firm, computer) and not the large (gross national
product, consumer price index, unemployment).

Economics of Defense in the Nuclear Age
.A
Hitch, C.J.
.W
  The purpose of this book is to explain a way of looking at military
problems which we and others with whom we have been associated have
found fruitful in insights and productive of solutions.  Essentially we
regard all military problems as, in one of their aspects, economic
problems in the efficient allocation and use of resources.  We believe
that this way of looking at military problems goes far toward reconciling
the apparent conflict of views between the officers and officials who are
responsible for defense and the officials and Congressmen whose primary
interest is economy - except in determining the over-all size of the
military budget, where conflict between these points of view is inevitable.

Educating the Library User
.A
Lubans, J.
.W
  Educating the Library User is a collection of original essays, case
studies, and research reports on the problems, hopes, and techniques of 
instructing library users and nonusers, from the kindergartener to the 
preschool adult, in the effective use of libraries and their resources.
Merging the library-use teachings of school, public, and academic
libraries, this book demonstrates the need for a consistent, sequential
plan of library-use instruction that crosses traditional library boundaries.

Education and Training for Scientific and Technological
Library and Information Work
.A
Schur, M.
.W
  The exponential growth of the literature of science and technology is a
phenomenon which scientists have been living with for the past 300 years.
It is in the nature of such growth that its effect is recognized only slowly,
but when a critical point is reached its consequences can be overwhelming.
In science information this point has now been reached.  To take but one 
field, chemistry, it took well over two centuries for the first million papers
to be published, and over 30 years, from 1907 to 1938, for the first million
to be abstracted in Chemical Abstracts.  We are now at the stage where one
million papers have been abstracted in a five-year period - 1962-1967 - and
before 1975 the point will have been reached where one million papers, equal
to the output of the whole pre-war generation of chemists, will be
published and abstracted in a single year. The first scientific serial began
publication in 1665.  Some 290 years later, in 1956, the Science Museum
Library was receiving 9,000 current scientific serials.  Within only a
further 11 years the National Lending Library for Science and Technology
(N.L.L.) was receiving over three times this number.  The growth in the use
of scientific literature is no less spectacular.  Thus, for example, in 1930
the number of loans by the Science Museum Library was 10,000.  In 1967 the
N.L.L., which had taken over the national lending function of the Science
Museum Library, lent well over half-a-million items, a total exceeding that of
all the loans by the Science Museum Library between 1929 and 1947 (a period
which itself saw the discovery of nuclear fission and its application for
peaceful uses, enormous progress in antibiotics, developments in synthetic
materials and great advances in all branches of science and technology).
There are some signs that the rate of increase implied in these examples
may not be maintained, but any flattening-out that may develop will be at
a very high level indeed.

Some User Requirements Stated Quantitatively 
in Terms of the 90 Percent Library
.A
Bourne, C.P.
.W
  Librarians, publishers, and information system engineers have very
little verified information and few guidelines to describe the user's specific
requirements for information.  Such information is needed to properly
design or evaluate the information systems.  To date, most of the statements
of requirements have been rather subjective, and often reflect opinion
rather than actual fact.  Relatively little objective data have been
obtained.  This is probably due in large part to the fact that there are
extremely difficult methodological problems in trying to determine and
state user requirements in a meaningful manner.  This paper suggests an
approach or point of view that might help this situation by providing a
method of phrasing the statements of user requirements in a more
convenient and meaningful manner.  This paper also furnishes several
examples of such statements, and discusses the techniques and data that
support these statements.
  In this paper, attention is initially focused on the information requirements
of workers in the field of science and technology, with no serious
attempt made to include workers in other fields.  However, it seems quite
likely that the approach, and perhaps even the stated principles, could be
extended and generalized to cover other fields of knowledge.

    Following five years of experience with the mechanization
of procedures using data processing equipment, the university
library in Bochum is attempting to summarize its findings.
A comparison with earlier publications about the use of
electronic data processing equipment shows in what measure
the original plans have actually been affected by the
experience that has been gained.  This summary also serves
as a report for the wider public that may be interested in
technical questions of library processing.

thousands of libraries, research institutes, educational institutions,
professional and trade associations, non-profit organizations, publishing
houses, government agencies, and others.  All of these groups are already
listed in a variety of existing directories.  This publication, on the other
hand, has selected from the above groups, those organizations and services
which are principally concerned with storage, retrieval, and dissemination
of information, and in addition, are innovative, experimental, or non-
conventional.  A major emphasis is on computerization, micrographics, networks,
advanced reference services, information centers, and data banks.
  The Encyclopedia of Information Systems and Services includes descriptions
of the following types of services and facilities:

  This publication describes and analyzes approximately 1750 organizations
concerned with new forms, new media, and new methods for providing information
services.  Among these organizations are publishers, computer software and time-
sharing companies, micrographic firms, libraries, information centers, and 
consultants.  The common interest of these diverse organizations is in service
based on storage and representation of structured information with output on a
recurring or demand basis.  The concept of information as used throughout this
book is defined as data organized into a collection of facts and most often
recorded in two basic forms: 1) textual data or literature, and 2) numeric
data.
  Roles played by the organizations described on the following pages vary but
include one or more of the following functions: data base creation, data base
publishing, data transmission, data manipulation and analysis, and data storage
and retrieval.  Emphasis in this publication is on organizations involved in
computerized services, micrographic applications, selective dissemination
of information (SDI), and networking.
  Not included in the Encyclopedia of Information Systems and Services are
printed commercial and legal services, traditional academic and special 
libraries, public information offices, hardware manufacturers and distributors
within the computer and micrographic field, conventional indexing and 
abstracting services, and most library automation programs which are limited
to such housekeeping functions as circulation, serials control, and 
acquisitions.

Citation Indexes
.A
Weinstock, M.
.W
  Citation indexing is a relatively new method of organizing the contents of a
collection of documents in a way that overcomes many of the shortcomings of the
more traditional indexing methods.  The primary advantage of citation indexing
is that it identifies relationships between documents that are often overlooked
in a subject index.  An important secondary advantage is that the compilation 
of citation indexes is especially well suited to the use of man-machine indexing
methods that do not require indexers who are subject specialists.  Furthermore,
citations, which are bibliographic descriptions of documents, are not 
vulnerable to scientific and technological obsolescence as are the terms used
in subject indexes.

Dialog Interactive Information Retrieval System
.A
Summet, R.K.
.W
  DIALOG is the name given to an interactive, computer-based information
retrieval language developed at the Lockheed Palo Alto Research Laboratory.  
The DIALOG systems consists of a series of computer programs which have been
designed to make full use of direct access memory devices (in which data 
located anywhere on the device can be accessed in approximately the same amount
of time) and video display units to provide the user a rapid and powerful means
of identifying records within a file which satisfy the particular information
need.  By providing the user full display access to the indexing vocabulary,
and the ability to modify search expressions, DIALOG becomes a data processing
extension of the human operator who directs and controls the process according
to his own personal needs.

Sources of Information on Specific Subjects
.A
Bradford, S.C.
.W
  An alternative hypothesis to
be investigated is that, to a considerable extent, the
references are scattered throughout all periodicals
with a frequency approximately related inversely
to the scope.  On this hypothesis, the aggregate of
periodicals can be divided into classes according to
relevance of scope to the subject concerned, but the
more remote classes will, in the aggregate, produce
as many references as the more related classes.  The
whole range of periodicals thus acts as a family of
successive generations of diminishing kinship, each
generation being greater in number than the
preceding, and each constituent of a generation 
producing inversely according to its degree of
remoteness. 
  The investigation covered, in the first place, the
references quoted, in the course of four and two and
a-half years respectively, by the current bibliographies
of Applied Geophysics and Lubrication, which are 
prepared in the library.  The source of each
reference being given, it was possible to arrange the
sources in order of productivity, the results being
set down in columns A and B of the table, in the
previous column.

Error-correcting Codes
.A
Peterson, W.W.
.W
  Several major developments have contributed to the rapid emergence
of the field of error-correcting codes over the past two decades.
Externally, the cost of solid-state electronic devices has decreased almost as
dramatically as their size.  This has stimulated the development of digital
computers and peripheral devices and this, in turn, has caused a dramatic
increase in the volume of data communicated between such
machines.  The intolerance of computing systems to error, and in some
cases the inherently critical nature of the data demand the use of either
error-free facilities or some type of error-detecting or correcting code in
the terminal devices.  In many cases the latter approach is the more 
economical.

The Evaluation of Information Services and Products
.A
King, D.W.
.W
  The continuing need to put scientists in contact with the research of
others, coupled with the rapidly expanding volume of published
material during the past several decades, has placed new emphasis on
the old arts of assembling, coding, and disseminating recorded
knowledge.  In some instances, the emphasis has manifested itself in
research on improvement of traditional library systems.  In other
instances, it has resulted in the assembly of specialized collections and
their intensive indexing for access in a variety of ways.  Still other
systems have progressed from the passive role of responding to
requests to the active role of supplying documents, or references to
them, to researchers as the documents become available.  For lack of a
more descriptive terminology, all of these activities are referred to in
this book as "document transfer systems," implying that the product
being retrieved (or disseminated) is a document rather than the
information (if any) in it.  That is, intelligence systems or fact retrieval
systems (if facts are indeed retrieved) are excluded from our concern.
The document, of course, may be a book, a journal article, a drawing,
an abstract, a piece of film, or a piece of magnetic tape.

Evaluation of MEDLARS Documentation
.A
Lancaster, f.W.
.W
  This report presents the results of a detailed analysis by
the National Library of Medicine of the performance of
MEDLARS (its Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval
System) in relation to 300 actual requests made to the
system in 1966 and 1967.  Thanks to this study, we now know
considerably more about the requirements of MEDLARS users,
how well the system is meeting these requirements, and what
we must do to improve the overall performance level.  The
investigation is timely:  the Library is now planning a
second-generation MEDLARS, and the design of MEDLARS II
should benefit greatly from our knowledge of factors affecting
the performance of the present system.

Evaluation of Micropublishing
.A
Veaner, A.B
.W
  Micropublishing, as it pertains to library materials, is essentially
a form of the republishing of materials no longer in print.  The need
for such materials of many kinds - monographs, serials, newspapers,
reference works - has grown greatly during the past quarter century and
this need is reflected in the growth of the micropublishing industry.  As
new colleges and junior colleges are founded, and established colleges
and universities continue to expand to meet growing educational needs,
both groups of institutions find that in more and more instances the
materials they need are available only in microform.  As a result, the
ratio of microforms to books in college and research libraries has been
steadily rising.

Evaluative Research Principles and Practice in Public Service and
Social Action Programs
.A
Suchman, E.A.
.W
  In these days of large government programs intended to reduce poverty,
develop communities, prevent delinquency and crime, control disease, and
reconstruct cities, the predominant rhetoric is that of planning, pilot
projects, experimental and demonstration programs - and evaluation.  Those
who seek to select for support the more promising plans and projects submitted
to funding agencies have become habituated to the ritualistic inclusion in
the proposal of a final section on Evaluation.  In most cases this section
consists of sometimes grandiose but usually vague statements of intent and
procedure for assessing the impact of the proposed action.  In some cases
there is an elegant, highly academic, and impractical scheme worked out in
meticulous detail by an obviously talented research consultant.  In a few
treasured instances there is a well-considered, realistic, and workmanlike
plan for getting some fairly reliable answers to the questions of what worked
and why.

Informal Communication in Science:
Its Advantages and its Formal Analogues
.A
Menzel, H.
.W
    Formal and informal scientific communication are complementary;
they must not be thought of as alternatives in the sense that,
perhaps, certain messages are obtained exclusively through the printed
word, the library, and the mechanized search-and-retrieval system,
whereas others are obtained by the exclusive use of word-of-mouth and
the telephone.  The much more typical event is one in which the receipt
of a single message is secured by the successive interplay of these two
kinds of communication.  For any given transaction between a scientist
as a receiver of information and the channel that brings him that
information usually has a history behind it and a future ahead of it that
may be very relevant to the evaluation of the success of that transaction
and to the prognosis of whether this kind of transaction will happen
again with similar results.

The Foundations of Education for Librarianship
.A
Shera, J.H.
.W
    The study is a result of a theory of librarianship which has been in the
process of maturation for more than a quarter century of teaching and
administration, first at the University of Chicago, and subsequently at Western
Reserve University, now Case Western Reserve University, and which has
been elaborated in essays and addresses as the inquiry progressed.
    My purpose has been to explore the role of the library as it contributes
to the total communication system in society and the meaning of that role
for the library profession, and having determined the requirements of that
role to identify those which are appropriately met by graduate professional
education.  Therefore, the inquiry begins with a consideration of the
communication system within the individual as related to his physiological,
neurological, and psychological structure, and its meaning for learning and
reading patterns and characteristics.  The study then progresses to an
exposition of the cultural environment and its communication system in society,
together with the place of the library in it.

A Guide to the Construction and Use of Special Schemes
.A
Vickery, B.C.
.W
  The use of classification in libraries is traditional and its value is
appreciated.  For documentation and information retrieval in
general, other techniques such as alphabetical indexing and
machine selection are also available.  That classification is of
value in information retrieval as well as in book arrangement is,
however, made evident in two ways.  First, to achieve consistency
and subtlety in alphabetical indexing and machine selection
designers of such retrieval systems find the need to introduce
classificatory techniques.  Second, there is a continuing demand
for the construction of special classifications for detailed arrangement
and cataloguing of documents in restricted but intensively
cultivated fields of knowledge.
  It is to help meet these demands, particularly the second, that
this guide has been prepared.  The techniques of detailed depth
classification have been greatly developed during the past decade,
and instruments of much greater subtlety and efficiency than the
traditional 'tree-of-knowledge' schemes can now be designed.
These developments have been reported mainly as research papers
in a variety of library journals and are often made unnecessarily
difficult to follow by the use of unfamiliar terminology.
There is a need for a more simply written and more readily
available practical guide to the use of the newer techniques of
classification.

Factors Determining the Performance of Indexing Systems
.A
Cleverdon, C.W.

Vol. 1

  The original Aslib-Cranfield investigations on the efficiency of indexing
systems (references 1, 2 and 3) did not, by itself, produce firm answers to 
what is one of the basic problems in information retrieval, namely the 
decision as to which index language should be used.  Certainly it did not, as 
some people had anticipated, demonstrate that one system was 'better' than 
another, either  generally, or in any given situation.

  The test results are presented for a number of different index languages
using various devices which affect recall or precision.  Within the environment
of this test, it is shown that the best performance was obtained with
the group of eight index languages which used single terms.  The group of
fifteen index languages which were based on concepts gave the worst performance,
while a group of six index languages based on the Thesaurus of
Engineering Terms of the Engineers Joint Council were intermediary.  Of
the single term index languages, the only method of improving performance
was to group synonyms and word forms, and any broader groupings of terms
depressed performance.  The use of precision devices such as links gave no
advantage as compared to the basic device of simple coordination.

Factors in the Transfer of Technology
.A
Gruber, W.H.
.W
  The strong correlation between the scope and depth of this country's
research and development activities and the vigor and the growth of its
industrial plant is today a widely accepted fact.  Government expenditures
for research and development have increased from a modest
annual rate of $200 million some thirty years ago to $17 billion today.
The research budgets of the private sector of the economy, which were
almost miniscule in the 1930's, total approximately $8 billion today.
These expenditures have had their many tangible and visible results,
ranging from nylon and antibiotics to radar and solid state electronics,
but what is not so generally appreciated is the additional product
represented by the increasing inventory of ideas and new knowledge
whose application, for the most part, is still a potential one.  The
sophisticated and often urgent nature of some of the larger products in
which we engage today, which require vast research expenditures to
find the efficient way, or the economical way, or the safe way, or the
most accurate way to accomplish some end purpose, also produces an
increase in the national level of scientific and technological competence
that has not yet been transferred into the civilian economy.  The
value of the technical ideas now stored and awaiting application can
be estimated as a value many times larger than the annual rate of
billions of dollars invested in the effort it took to develop this increased
technical capability.  As a national resource for underwriting further
economic and industrial development, this technical inventory is a
factor of major importance.

review the history of the struggle for faculty status for
librarians and some of the arguments advanced in support of
that objective; and (2) to gather information on the 
similarities and differences between librarians and faculty 
members in the broad areas of preparation, contributions,
and rewards.  With detailed information on such matters
as education, salaries, professional experience, tenure, sabbaticals,
participation in academic government, and scholarly activity
of librarians and faculty members, one should be able to
judge whether librarians receive unfair or unequal treatment.

Farewell to Alexandria 
Solution to space, growth, and performance problems of libraries
.A
Gore, D.

  The publication of this collection of essays opens a new era for
libraries, taking the first departure in 2,300 years from that durable
model conceived by the librarians of Alexandria and endlessly replicated
by every succeeding generation of librarians, right down to the present
day.  The Alexandrian model persists through the unexamined faith
that to be good a library must be vast and always growing.  The papers
presented here examine that faith scientifically, demonstrate that it
rests on nothing more solid than mistaken intuition, and consign it to
the limbo of outworn dogmas.

A Feasibility Study of Centralized and Regionalized Inter-Library
Loan Centers
.A
Stevens, R.E.
.W
  The two major problems of the present system are (1) the unequal
distribution of lending, with a few of the largest libraries handling
a large proportion of the requests, and (2) the difficulty of filling
requests which are incomplete, incorrect, or inadequately checked.
  Solutions proposed for these two problems have been (1)
compensation to the largest libraries for each transaction, and (2)
better bibliographic checking of requests before they are forwarded to
the lending library.

Biomedical Literature:
Volume, Growth, and Other Characteristics

Orr, R.H.
Leeds, A.A.
.W
  This study's aim was to gather and analyze
reliable data on the quantifiable characteristics of the
biomedical literature that affects communication problems within
the research community.  Previous studies and standard
bibliographic compilations were critically reviewed, particularly
for data that could be used to determine changes with time.
In addition, all publications generated during 1961-1962 by
the extramural and intramural research programs of the
National Institutes of Health (NIH) were analyzed as samples
of the current document output of US research.

Formal Languages
.A
Salomaa, A.
.W
  This book develops a theory of formal languages from the point of view of
generative devices, mainly grammars.  Recognition devices, automata, are
introduced only as a secondary tool and are themselves presented within the
framework of rewriting systems.
  The main emphasis is on mathematical aspects of formal languages rather
than application.  People interested only in applications to programming
languages (resp. natural languages) would certainly prefer a more
comprehensive discussion on topics such as LR(k) grammars (resp. 
transformational grammars).  Such discussions lie outside the scope of
this book.

Formal Languages and Their Relation to Automata
.A
Hopcroft, J.E.  
.W
  This book presents the theory of formal languages as a coherent theory
and makes explicit its relationship to automata.  The book begins with an
explanation of the notion of a finite description of a language.  The
fundamental descriptive device - the grammar - is explained, as well as
its three major subclasses - regular, context-free, and context-sensitive
grammars.  The context-free grammars are treated in detail, and such topics
as normal forms, derivation trees, and ambiguity are covered.  Four types of
automata equivalent to the four types of grammars are described.  These
automata are the finite automaton, the pushdown automaton, the linear
bounded automaton, and the Turing machine.  The Turing machine is covered in
detail, and unsolvability of the halting problem shown.  The book concludes
with certain advanced topics in language theory - closure properties,
computational complexity, deterministic pushdown automata, LR(k) grammars,
stack automata, and decidability.

Informal Channels of Communication In the Behavioral Sciences:
Their Relevance In the Structuring of Formal or Bibliographic
Communication
.A
Garvey, W.D.
Griffith, B.C.
.W
    What are the needs being served by informal communication?
What can be done about giving informal communication, without
destroying its function for the active researcher, certain of
the advantages of formal communication, such as, general
accessibility, permanence, etc.?  How can formal channels be
manipulated to take on the characteristics of informal
communication?  To cast light on these questions the present
paper examines the role of informal and formal channels within
the overall system of scientific dissemination in psychology,
considers the special advantages of informal communication,
and outlines certain relations between informal and formal
channels.  In a final section of the paper, two experiments
in scientific communication are described; one experiment being
built about an innovation that attempts to "informalize" formal
channels while the other is built about another innovation that,
in general, attempts to "formalize" an informal channel.

Functional Approach
.A
Sgall, P.
.W
  The present book sums up a certain stage in the research on algebraic
linguistics being pursued at Charles University, Prague.  It is based mainly
on P. Sgall's book (1967a, in Czech), which represents the first attempt at a
systematic formulation of the conception of generative description that has
gradually been elaborated by our research group.
  We do not claim that any particular question has been answered here in a
definitive way, but the conception of a generative system based on an
articulation of the semantic relation (see Section 1.3.4) may perhaps be
interesting in connection with the present development of algebraic linguistics.
This conception originated in 1963-1964, mainly as a reaction to the existing
form of transformational description.  It has not yet been possible to take the
more recent impulses into account to an extent that would be adequate to their
scope and theoretical significance.  Only some aspects of these impulses are
commented on in the relevant parts of the present book.  We do not present a
complete characterization of a system that could be regarded as a counterpart
to the new version of transformational grammar.  We have simply tried
to formulate a conception that can serve as a starting point for the
development of a new alternative.

Future Developments in Telecommunications
.A
Martin, J.
.W
  Communication technology has entered a period of revolutionary change.
  The last decade has brought new inventions of enormous potential.
It will probably be two decades before we fully grasp the shattering effect
they will have on society.
  These inventions include:
  The communication satellite.  Suddenly this has provided telephone
and television links to the underdeveloped world.  Much larger satellites
will be built and will have an enormous impact on education and
communications both in the United States and throughout the world.  The
satellite antennae in some underdeveloped countries stand next to fields
ploughed by oxen.
  The helical waveguide.  A pipe, now operating, that can carry 250,000
simultaneous telephone calls or equivalent information over long distances.
  The laser.  This means of transmission, still in the research laboratory,
has the potential of carrying many millions of simultaneous telephone calls
or their equivalent.
  Large-scale integration (LSI).  A form of ultraminiaturized computer
circuitry that probably marks the beginning of mass production of
computers and computerlike logic circuitry.  It offers the potential of
extremely reliable, extremely small, and, in some of its forms, extremely
fast computers.  If large-enough quantities can be built, this circuitry can
become very low in cost.
  On-line real-time computers.  Computers capable of responding to many
distant terminals on telecommunication lines at a speed geared to human
thinking.  They have the potential of bringing the power and information
of innumerable computers into every office and eventually every home.
  Picturephone.  A public dial-up telephone system in which subscribers
see as well as hear each other.
  Large TV screens.  TV screens that can occupy a whole wall if necessary.
  Cable TV.  Provides a cable into homes with a potential signal-carrying
capacity more than one thousand times that of the telephone cable.  It
could be used for signals other than television.
  Voice answerback.  Computers can now assembly human-voice words and
speak them over the telephone.  This fact, coupled with the Touchtone
telephone set, makes every such telephone a potential computer terminal.
  Millimeter-wave radio.  Radio at frequencies in the band above the
microwave band can relay a quantity of information greater than all the
other radio bands combined.  Chains of closely spaced antennas will distribute
these millimeter-wave signals.
  Pulse code modulation.  All signals, including telephone, Picturephone,
music, facsimile, and television can be converted into digital bit stream
and transmitted, along with computer data, over the same digital links.
Major advantages accrue from this.
  Computerized switching.  Computerized telephone exchanges are coming into
operation, and computer-like logic can be employed for switching and
"concentrating" all types of signals.
  Data banks.  Electronic storage for huge quantities of information that
can be manipulated and indexed by computers and that can be accessed in a
fraction of a second.

Future Shock
.A
Toffler, A.
.W
  This is a book about what happens to people when they are
overwhelmed by change.  It is about the ways in which we adapt
- or fail to adapt - to the future.
  Much has been written about the future.  Yet, for the most
part, books about the world to come sound a harsh metallic note.
These pages, by contrast, concern themselves with the "soft" or
human side of tomorrow.  Moreover, they concern themselves
with the steps by which we are likely to reach tomorrow. They
deal with common, everyday matters - the products we buy and
discard, the places we leave behind, the corporations we inhabit,
the people who pass at an ever faster clip through our lives.  The
future of friendship and family life in probed.  Strange new
subcultures and life styles are investigated, along with an array of
other subjects from politics and playgrounds to skydiving and sex.

and evaluate the position of the public library in the structure
of government in the United States.  The use of the word
"government" in the title, therefore, is deliberate.  We are
here concerned with the legal forms and types of governmental
organization of the public library and with its relation to
the city or other political unit to which it is attached or
which it serves.

Government Publications:  A Guide to Bibliographic Tools
.A
Palic, V.M.
.W
  The expansion of government at all levels - international, national,
provincial or state, and local - has resulted in increasing government
influence on the life of each citizen.  Concomitant with this development
is the proliferation of published directives, regulations, reports,
technical studies, and other informational issuances in such volume that no
one engaged in a business or profession, no financial tycoon, educator,
researcher, farmer, housewife, welfare recipient, or unemployed person can
function without some reference to government publications.  Yet, in few
areas of recorded human knowledge have control and bibliographic aids
been so little systemized. 
  The present work, designed to provide the prospective user as well as
the trained researcher and librarian with a guide to the maze, is a direct
descendant of the Childs essay.  The extent to which the mass of published
material has grown is underscored by the contrasting physical size of the
two publications; Childs' was a 78-page pamphlet containing approximately
400 entries whereas this book of over 400 pages cites more than 3,000 titles.

to provide the reader with an understanding of the characteristics of the
classification, the arrangement within the classes, the format of the schedules
and tables, and special problems of use and notation.  The reader should trace
the analysis of each example of classing through the pages from the L.C. 
schedule provided in the guide.  It is important to remind the reader that a
thorough study of each class schedule in addition to the recommended readings
is essential.  The author realizes that many imperfections may be present in
this guide and will appreciate suggestions for changes from readers.

Guide to Reference Books
.A
Winchell, C.M.
.W
  The fundamental principles of reference work remain
more or less constant through the years, but the rapid
expansion of the publication of reference books in all
fields makes essential a careful selection to fit the needs
of each library.  The purpose of this volume is to list
reference books basic to research - general and special -
and thus to serve as: (1) a reference manual for the
library assistant, research worker, or other user of
library resources; (2) a selection aid for the librarian; and
(3) a textbook for the student, who, either in library
school, training class, or college course in bibliography,
is pursuing a systematic study of reference books.
  The needs of these types of users have influenced the
organization and make-up of this volume, in that the
requirements of the first two groups have made the
manual more comprehensive than it might have been if
intended for a textbook only, while the introductions to
sections and many of the annotations have been provided
particularly for the library school student.

Task Force of the Federal Library Committee, sponsored and monitored by the
U.S. Office of Education, and carried out by the System Development 
Corporation.  The project included a questionnaire survey of all Federal
libraries (2104), as of December, 1970, to gather systems planning data and 
to identify Federal libraries with operational or planned automated systems.
Respondents in the latter group were sent a Federal Library Automation Survey
questionnaire requesting specific details about existing and planned systems.
From these sources, amplified by visits to Federal libraries and an extensive
review of the automation literature, information was distilled for use in
this Handbook.

Handbook of Comparative Librarianship
.A
Simsova, S.
.W
  The first part, written by myself, deals with 'Comparative
librarianship and comparative method' and is intended for both
teachers of comparative librarianship and their students.  It can be
approached in a number of ways:  The first three chapters outline
comparative librarianship and the theoretical basis of its
methodology against the wider background of other comparative sciences
and the scientific method.  The three chapters following are purely
practical and explain the various steps of writing a comparative
study.  The last chapter is intended for teachers.
  The second part, compiled by Mrs. MacKee, is a bibliographical
guide to the main sources on librarianship throughout the world.
It draws on the bibliographies collected by comparative librarianship
students in the course of their project work, on replies to a
questionnaire sent to the various library associations of the world,
and on Mrs. MacKee's own collection of references gathered over a
number of years.

Handbook of Data Processing for Libraries
.A
Hayes, R.M.
.B
1970
.W
  The purpose of this book, therefore, is to assist libraries and librarians in
resolving some of the problems faced in utilizing this new technology.  The
intent is to provide a concrete, factual guide to the principles and methods
available for the application of modern data processing to library operations.
For the operating librarian, it should be considered a handbook, a tool to
guide him in decisions concerning the introduction of data processing techniques
into his own library.  For the student, it should be a textbook, educating him
not only in methodology but also in the interrelationships between data 
processing and the library.  For the system designer, it should be a summary
of the state-of-the-art, serving as a bridge between library objectives and
the technology.  The book, throughout, lays special stress on the library and,
particularly, on the significance of library values and policies for determining
the choice of system.  The book gives emphasis to the computer, but always in
the context of applying this technology to the solution of operating problems,
as an addition to resources for information service, as a tool of good
management, and not as an end in itself.  At most, therefore, the book aims to
educate the profession in the use of these tools, and in the special problems
of applying them to libraries.  In this respect, much of the groundwork has
already been done - the profession has been educating itself, has carried out
analyses of library operations, has experimented with mechanization, and is
developing better concepts of cost control.  The book merely continues a
process that is already underway.

HDB of Data Processing for Libraries
.A
Hayes, R.M.
.W
  The four years since the first edition of this book was published have been a
period of exceptional advance in the usage of computers in libraries.  Where
one or two examples were all that were available at that time to illustrate
each kind of application, now there are five to ten; where the cadre of
knowledgeable people in libraries at that time was small, now virtually
every major library has some kind of systems department; where the efforts at
that time were largely experimental and developmental, now there is a wealth.
This second edition has therefore been written in a context totally different
from that of the first.
  But its aims are the same; to ensure that practicing librarians and that
students in library schools approach the world of automation with knowledge
of its capabilities and limitations and with the techniques of systems
analysis by which to analyze and evaluate alternative answers to the library's
processing problems.  The changes from the first edition therefore represent
not a departure from that purpose but simply an updating of its content, to
reflect the advances and experience gained, and an opportunity to correct
the errors (hopefully minor) that have been found through use of the first
edition.

Handbook of Medical Library Practice
.A
Annan, G.L.
.W
  The Medical Library Association has long been aware of the need for a
third edition of the Handbook.  Changes in library practices, proliferating
demands upon established libraries, and the development of new ones
created the need of an up-to-date tool.  Like the earlier editions,
this Handbook is such a tool, a manual, not a survey of the state of the
art.  It offers practical advice to all - fledgling librarians starting
their careers, experienced librarians transferring to the field of
health sciences, established medical librarians refreshing memories or
adopting procedures unfamiliar to them, and specialists in related fields.

Handbook of the National and International Libraries

Fang, J.R.

  Two methods were used:  (1) A thorough search of professional
literature, principally since 1965, with exceptions in
cases where no later information was available, and (2) direct
communication with associations through a questionnaire and
consultation of supplementary material provided by the associations.
The final result of the authors' search was a total of 319
library associations, 33 international in scope and 286 national
(see Statistical Data).

The Hidden Dimension
.A
Hall, E.T.
.W
  Generally speaking, there are two types of books of interest to the
serious reader today:  those that are content oriented, designed to
convey a particular body of knowledge, and those that deal with structure,
the way in which events are organized.  It is doubtful if an author 
has any control over which of these two types of books he writes,
though it is desirable that he be aware of the difference.  The same
applies to the reader whose satisfaction depends largely on his
unstated expectations.  In today's world, when all of us are overwhelmed
with data from many sources, it is easy to understand why people
are apt to feel that they are losing touch with developments even in
their own field.  One senses that there is also a growing awareness
of a loss of relatedness to the world at large.  This loss of relatedness
leads to an increased need for organizing frames of reference to aid
in intergrating the mass of rapidly changing information with which man
must cope. The Hidden Dimension attempts to provide just this.

Historical Introduction to Library School
.A
White, C.M.
.W
    This is a revision and enlargement of Origins of the American Library
School.
    Someone has observed that the roots of the present lie deep in the
past and must be uncovered to understand fully how the present came to
be what it is.  This study is less a descriptive history of library schools
and their work than a search for perspective within which major problems,
as well as the course pursued in resolving them, can be more fully
understood.  The original study, begun in 1941-42, sought to throw light
on how library education at that time came to be what is was.  The
present study continues beyond the early forming of the American library
school to the reforming of basic lines of policy and organization.  A new
title is used to reflect the broadened scope.

The History of Libraries in the Western World
.A
Johnson, E.D.
.W
    The present work is an attempt to trace the history of libraries
in the western world:  to indicate how libraries developed and how
they influenced the social and cultural history of our civilization.
The book is intended for the student of library science or of cultural
history and for the general reader interested in the development of western
civilization.  Much has been omitted concerning libraries and librarians
that could have been included; conversely, some facts could have been
omitted without seriously detracting from the story as a whole but have
been included to illustrate how library history developed; they point out
the high spots and indicate trends.

Human Behavior and the Principles of Least Effort 
An Introduction to Human Ecology
.A
Zipf, G.K.
.W
  Nearly twenty-five years ago it occurred to me that we might gain 
considerable insight into the mainsprings of human behavior if we viewed it
purely as a natural phenomenon like everything else in the universe, and if
we studied it with the same dispassionate objectivity with which one is wont
to study, say, the social behavior of bees, or the nestbuilding habits of
birds.  The present book reports the results of the extended inquiry that
ensued in the course of those years, and which led to the disclosure of
some fundamental principles that seem to govern important aspects of our
behavior, both as individuals and as members of social groups.

Human Problem Solving
.A
Newell, A.
Simon, H.A.
.W
    The present study is concerned with the performance of intelligent adults
in our own culture.  The tasks discussed are short (half-hour), moderately
difficult problems of a symbolic nature.  The three main tasks we use - chess,
symbolic logic, and algebra-like puzzles (called cryptarithmetic puzzles) -
typify this class of problems.  The study is concerned with the integrated
activities that constitute problem solving.  It is not centrally concerned
with perception, motor skill, or what are called personality variables.
The study is concerned primarily with performance, only a little with
learning, and not at all with development or differences related to age.
Finally, it is concerned with integrated activities, hence deemphasizes the
details of processing on the time scale of elementary reactions (that is,
half a second or less).  Similarly, long-term integrated activities extending
over periods of days or years receive no attention.

The Human Side of Enterprise
.A
McGregor, D.
.W
    This volume is an attempt to substantiate the thesis that the
human side of enterprise is "all of a piece" - that the theoretical
assumptions management holds about controlling its human resources
determine the whole character of the enterprise.  They determine
also the quality of its successive generations of management.
    Of course the process is circular, and herein lies the possibility
and the hope of future progress.  The key question for top management
is:  "What are your assumptions (implicit as well as explicit) about
the most effective way to manage people?"  From the answer to this
question flow the answers to the questions Mr. Sloan raised in our
discussion about the making of managers, as well as answers to many
other questions which perplex and confound management as it seeks to
achieve more successfully the economic objectives of enterprise.  It
will be clear to the reader that I believe many of our present assumptions
about the most effective way to manage people are far from adequate.

A Statistical Approach to Mechanized Encoding and Searching of Literary 
Information
.A
Luhn, H.P.
.W
   Written communication of ideas is carried out on the basis of statistical 
probability in that a writer chooses that level of subject specificity and that
combination of words which he feels will convey the most meaning.. Since this
process varies among individuals and since similar ideas are therefore relayed
of different levels of specificity and by means of different words, the problem
of literature searching by machines still present major difficulties.. A 
statistical approach  to this problem will be outlined and the various steps
of a system based on this approach will be described.. Steps include the 
statistical analysis of a collection of document in a field of interest, the 
establishment of a set of "notions" and the vocabulary by which they are
expressed, the compilation of a thesaurus-type dictionary and index, the
automatic encoding of documents by machine with the aid of such a dictionary,
the encoding of topological notations (such as branches structures), the 
recording of the coded information, the establishment of a searching pattern 
for finding pertinent information, and the programming of appropriate machines
to carry out a search..

The Automatic Creation of Literature Abstracts
.A
Luhn, H.P.
.W
   Experts of technical papers and magazine articles that serve the purposes of
conventional abstracts have been created entirely by automatic means.. In the
exploratory research described, the complete text of an article in machine-
readable form is scanned by an IBM 704 data-processing machine and analyzed 
in accordance with a standard program..  Statistical information derived from 
word frequency and distribution is used by the machine to compute a relative 
measure of significance, first for individual words and then for sentences..
Sentences scoring highest in significance are extracted and printed out to 
become the "auto-abstract"..

A Business Intelligence System
.A
Luhn, H.P.
.W
   An automatic system is being developed to disseminate information to the 
various sections of any industrial, scientific or government organization.. 
This intelligence system will utilize data-processing machines for auto-
abstracting and auto-encoding of documents and for creating interest profiles
for each of the "action points" in an organization.. Both incoming and 
internally generated documents are automatically abstracted, characterized by a
word pattern, and sent automatically to appropriate action points.. This paper
shows the flexibility of such a system in identifying known information, in
finding who needs to know it and in disseminating it efficiently either in 
abstract form or as a complete document..

On Some Clustering Techniques
.A
Bonner, R.E.
.W
   The problem of organizing a large mass of data occurs frequently in 
research.. Normally, some process of generalization is used to compress the 
data so that it can be analyzed more easily.. A primitive step in this process 
is the "clustering" technique, which involves gathering together similar data 
into a cluster to permit a significant generalization..
   This paper describes a number of methods which make use of IBM 7090 computer
programs to do clustering.. A medical research problem is used to illustrate
and compare these methods..

R and D Project Selection:  Where We Stand

Baker, N.R.
Pound, W.H.
.W
   A review of the literature on R and D project selection and an analysis of 
interview data suggest that there is a lack of testing and use of the methods
proposed.. Several OR-MS methods are identified and their current status is
indicated.. Three representative procedures are examined in some detail.. It is
argued that both a lack of testing concerning feasibility and shortcomings of
the models themselves, help to explain why the methods have not been used.. 
Some of these shortcomings are identified and discussed.. Implications for 
future research are presented..

A Method for Allocating R & D Expenditures
.A
Rosen, E.M.
Souder, W.E.
.W
   The analytical problems of developing quantitative techniques for R & D 
investment management are often complicated by the existence of conflicting 
goals.. Corporate goals may require the R & D  manager to simultaneously seek
the highest probable profits, the largest probable number of successes, and the
greatest probable profit per dollar spent.. Departmental goals may restrict the
manager to some maximum budget, a minimum number of projects to be worked on, 
and minimum levels of accomplishment on specific projects.. In a sense, then, 
the research manager is faced with a constrained multiple-output production 
problem: how much to spend on which project and how much to spend overall.. 
This  paper shows how a slight modification of Hess' approach to project
selection  and an analogy to the theoretical economics of a multiple-product
factory have been used to help our research management simultaneously solve
these project selection, resource allocation, and budget determination 
problems..  Most approaches in the literature have treated these three problems
separately..

The Effects of Perceived Need and Means on the Generation of Ideas for
Industrial Research and Development Projects
.A
Baker, Norman R.
Siegman, Jack
Rubenstein, Albert H.
.W
   A flow model is presented which identifies some of the organizational 
factors influencing idea generation behavior in industrial R&D laboratories.. 
The model is constructed from literature-based propositions which make 
explicit the role played by several organizational factors identified in the
model.. Data were collected on about 300 ideas created in a divisional 
laboratory of a major U.S. corporation.. In general, these data support the
a priori propositions.. Further, data analysis suggests that two pieces of
information are required before an idea is generated: 1) knowledge of a need,
problem, or opportunity relevant to the company; and, 2) knowledge of a means or
technique for satisfying the need, solving the problem, or capitalizing on the 
opportunity.. These results are discussed with respect to the stage of creative
thought proposed by other investigators.. Finally, the organizational events,
which were associated as "needs" events or "means" events for the ideas studies,
are identified and analyzed with respect to both quantity and quality of ideas..

The Validity of Subjective Probability of Success Forecasts
by R & D Project Managers
.A
Souder, W.D.
.W
    Models and techniques to aid management in planning
controlling R&D projects frequently use subjective probability of
success forecasts as one of the major inputs.  An experiment was
conducted at the research laboratories of Monsanto Company to
measure the predictive validity and consistency of such forecasts.
The results indicate that the eventual success or failure of certain
types of R&D projects can be predicted by measuring the time shape
of polled probability of success forecasts.  Probability of success
forecasts appear to yield more valid advance warning indicators than
several commonly used project status measures.  These results tend
to support the hypothesis that R&D planning and control models that
are based on subjective probability estimates may reliably be used
by management to aid in early identification of eventually failing
projects, as well as to aid in project selection and project funding.

they are based on linear, integer, chance constrained, or dynamic programming..
Representative examples from these classes are described and evaluated in 
detail.. The evaluation is on terms of data requirements; built-in assumptions;
ease of computation; usefulness of outputs; versatility of application..

The Information Content of Titles in Engineering Literature
.A
Bottle, Robert T. 
.W
   Since many alerting and information services rely very heavily on the use
of titles to transfer information to the potential user, it is essential that 
he be aware of the proportion of the information contained in the complete
document which will not be deducible from the title and which he will therefore
miss.. Methods will be discussed for analyzing the relative information content
of the titles of engineering paper and results presented for the amount and 
type of information lost through scanning title listing only..
   Between one-third and one-half of indexable terms are not retrievable from
article titles even if all possible synonyms and  related terms are used.. If
all synonyms are used instead of one keyword the amount of information 
retrieved is increased by about 70 percent.. The problems of dealing with
synonyms and with syntactical variants in searching titles indexes are 
discussed.. The possibility of using keywords in journal titles as 
supplementary retrieval tags is suggested since they were deemed useful in
nearly one-third of the sample of papers analyzed..

On Fuzzy Mapping and Control

   A fuzzy mapping from X to Y is a fuzzy set on X * Y.. The concept is 
extended to fuzzy mappings of fuzzy set on X to Y, fuzzy function and its 
inverse, fuzzy parametric function, fuzzy observation, and control.. Set
theoretical relations are obtained for fuzzy mappings, fuzzy functions, and 
fuzzy parametric functions.. It is shown that under certain conditions a 
precise control goal can be attained with fuzzy observation and control as long 
as the observations become sufficiently precise when the goal is approached..

Cooperation Between Types of Libraries An annotated bibliography
1969-1971 supplement
.A
Gilluly, M.E.
Wert, L.M.
.W
  This bibliography is designed to supplement capitalize Between Types of 
Libraries 1940-1956 An Annotated Bibliography by Ralph H. Stenstrom.  The staff
of the Library Research Center at the University of Illinois in cooperation
with the Illinois State Library plans to issue an annual supplement which will 
appear in Illinois libraries each year.  It is hoped the supplements issued in 
this manner can be cumulated periodically and issued in monograph form.

Illustrative Computer Programming for Libraries
.A
Davis, C.H.
.W
  Illustrative Computer Programming is intended as
a graded workbook or text supplement containing
typical practical problems, suggested solutions, and
tried analyses which emphasize programming efficiency
and some of the major features of PL/I (Programming
Language/One).  As such, it can be used alone or in
combination with established PL/I textbooks such as
those listed in the Selected Bibliography.  Programmers
with knowledge of other languages will not be bothered
by excessive introductory material, while beginners can
learn much by looking at the solutions to the problems
and their accompanying analyses.

Improving Access to Library Resources
.A
Dougherty, R.M.
.W
    The motivation for this investigation derived from a
series of visits to institutions which were deeply committed
to the design, development, and operation of non-traditional
automated information systems.  At the time of the visits,
the systems seemed to be working technically but, paradoxically,
they did not appear to have made a significant impact on the
respective user communities.  Although few people associated
with the systems openly expressed concern, there were non-verbal
indicators which suggested that some people were becoming nervous.
Since all of the systems represented high expenditures of time
and money, a feeling of uneasiness seemed quite appropriate.

Indexing Languages and Thesauri: Construction and Maintenance
.A
Soergel, D.
.W
  This book has two objectives.  First, to reassess thoroughly the functions
of an indexing language or thesaurus in a information storage and retrieval
system and in the light of this reassessment to analyze the structure of 
indexing languages and thesauri.  Most importantly, this reassessment is based
on a unified view of indexing languages (classification schemes) and thesauri 
as information storage and retrieval systems on the other.  It results in 
general principles that are applicable to a wide range of situations.

Industrial Research and Technological Innovation an Econometric Analysis
.A
Mansfield, E.
.W
   After many years of neglect, technological change is receiving the attention
from economists that it deserves, the 1960's being a time of a enormous 
interest in this area in academic, government, and business circles.. Central 
to the economics of technological change is the manner in which new processes
and products are conceived, developed, commercialized, and accepted.. To help
promote a better understanding of this process, I have been engaged for a 
number of years in a series of related econometric studies of industrial 
research and technological innovation.. The purpose of this book is to bring
together the results of these studies..

Industry and Technical Progress
.A
Carter, C.F.
.W
  This book is written in the belief that the full and speedy application
of science in industry is necessary to economic progress, and
should indeed be one of the most important objectives of national
policy.  This being so, it is important to identify the hindrances to
speedy application.  Many people have already drawn attention to
particular hindrances but the three bodies which have sponsored this report
did not consider that there was any up-to-date assessment of the problem
which attempted to look at it as a whole, in all its variety and complexity.
Hence the investigation which they undertook, and largely entrusted to us;
an investigation which, through the great goodwill of many people in British
industry, has yielded so much material that this book can only be a first
impression and summary.

Inequality; a reassessment of the effect of family and schooling in America
.A
Jenchs, C.
.W
  This book summarizes the results of three years of research at the
Center for Educational Policy Research.  The eight coauthors were all
Research Associates at the Center, and our work there was a collaborative
effort.  We plagiarized both ideas and data from one another.  Most of
us also spent a good deal of time criticizing one another's work.  While
each of us took primary responsibility for certain lines of inquiry, and
this responsibility is recorded in appropriate footnotes, we see our
research as an integrated effort which should bear all our names.

Research Studies in Patterns of Scientific Communication: I.
General Description of Research Program

Garvey, William D.

Tomita, Kazuo

   This article is the first in a series which described the general procedures 
and some findings of over seventy studies which we conducted from 1966 to 1971 
on the information-exchange activities of over 12000 scientists and engineers 
in a sample of nine physical, social and engineering sciences.. We designed the
studies so that (a) the full spectrum of scientific communication media could 
be explored, (b) the various studies were coupled in order that data obtained
from one study could be directly related to those obtained from other studies,
(c) the scheduling of the studies was conducted in real time in order that the 
same body of information could be followed from its inception to its final 
integration into the general body of scientific knowledge, and (d) the same 
studies were conducted for all nine disciplines being studied in order that 
genuine comparisons could be made among them.. The data are now stored on
machine-readable magnetic tapes and will be made available to scholars in the 
field of information science..

The Continuity of Dissemination of Information by "Productive Scientists"
.A
Garvey, William D.
Lin, Nan
Tomita, Kazuo
.W
   This article is the last in series which describes a set of studies which
were conducted over a 4,5-year period (1966-1971).. The series of articles 
sought to describe a comprehensive picture of the dissemination and assimilation
of scientific information as it flows through various informal and formal media,
from the time a scientist initiates his work until it is published.. The 
present article examines the continuity of scientific work and information 
exchange by "productive scientists" two years after the publication of their 
articles in 1968/1969.. The results indicate that about half of the authors had
changed to a subject-matter area which differed from that of their earlier
articles, however, such shifts did not decrease authors' productivity nor 
greatly increase their information needs..

Inference and Disputed Authorship
.A 
Mosteller, F.
.W
  We apply a 200-year-old mathematical theorem to a 175-year-old historical
problem, more to advance statistics than history.  Though problems of disputed
authorship are common in history, literature, and politics, scholars regard their
solutions as minor advances.  For us the question of whether Hamilton or
Madison wrote the disputed Federalist papers has served as a laboratory and
demonstration problem for developing and comparing statistical methods.
While we help solve this historical problem, our practical application of Bayes'
theorem to a large analysis of data is a step in testing the feasibility of a
method being explored with fresh attitudes and fresh mathematics.  Furthermore,
large practical applications have until now been few, and our work helps fill
that gap.

Storage Analysis of a Compression Coding for Document Data Bases
.A
Heaps, H.S.
.W
   Analysis is made of the effect of using an efficient code of compression of
terms within a document data base.. The storage efficiency  is expressed in 
terms of the vocabulary length and the values of certain parameters which 
describe the structure of the code.. For vocabularies of up to 100,000 terms
the average code length is approximately twelve bits.. No information is lost
through term truncation or abbreviation.. The tables required for coding and 
decoding may be ordered for rapid access without reduction in the ease of 
update..

Quantitative Fuzzy Semantics
.A
Zaden, L.A.
.W
   The point of departure in this paper is the definition of a language, L, as
a fuzzy relation from a set of terms, T = {x}, to a universe of discourse, 
U = {y}.. As a fuzzy relation, L is characterized by its membership function
mL:T*U -> [0,1], which associates with each ordered pair (x,y) its grade of 
membership, mL(x,y), in L.. 
   Given a particular x in T, the membership function mL(x,y) defines a fuzzy
set, M(x), in U whose membership function is given by mM(x)(y) = mL(X,y)..
The fuzzy set M(x) is defined to be the meaning of the term x, with x playing 
the role of a name for M(x)..
   If a term x in T is a concatenation of other terms in T, that is,
x = x1 ... xn, xi  T, i epsilon 1,...,n, then the meaning of x can be expressed in 
terms of the meanings of x1,...,xn through the use of a lambda-expression or by
solving a system of equations in the membership functions of the xi which are 
deduced from the syntax tree of x.. The use of this approach is illustrated by 
examples..

On Relevance as a Measure
.A
Coffman, William
.W
   Relevance is defined as a measure of information conveyed by a document 
relative to a query.. It is shown that the relationship between the document 
and the query, though necessary, is not sufficient to determine relevance..

A Definition of Relevance for Information Retrieval
.A
Cooper, W.S.
.W
   The concept of "relevance", sometimes also called "pertinence" or 
"aboutness", is central to the theory of information retrieval.. Unfortunately,
however, there is at present no consensus as to how this notion should be 
defined.. The purpose of this paper is to propose and defend a definition of
what it means to say that a piece of stored information is "relevant" to the
information need of a retrieval system user..
   The suggested definition explicates relevance in terms of logical 
implication.. For one yes-or-no question answering system which operates with
one of the standard formalized languages, the definition provides a 
mathematically precise criterion of relevance.. For other types of fact 
retrieval systems and reference retrieval systems, including all systems whose 
stored information is expressed in natural language, the definition is not  
mathematically precise but is nevertheless still helpful on a conceptual 
level..

Computer Assisted Indexing
.A
Gray, W. A.
.W
   The paper describes a technique which enables an on line computer based
information retrieval system to aid the indexers by selecting possible index 
terms to be assigned to a new document entering the system..
   The method analyses the index terms assigned to the references cited by the 
new article.. This produces a list of index terms weighted according to their 
expected correlation with the subject matter of the new article.. Thus, the 
indexer is presented with the weighted list of proposed indexing terms as an 
aid..
   An evaluation is made of the results produced by the technique for a trial
set of documents.. These documents have already been indexed for the MEDLARS 
system.. The list of actual index terms for this trial set of documents is 
compared with the set of index terms proposed by the technique for each 
document.. The results of this comparison are encouraging, and they are 
discussed in the paper..
   The economic aspects of implementing the technique in a working information 
retrieval system is considered.. This included the expected benefits, and an 
estimate of the cost of using the technique as an aid in terms of computer 
time and indexer time..

A Note on the Concept of "Relevance"
.A
Foskett, D.J.
.W
  Two recent articles in this journal (Konigova [1], Cooper [2]) have gone
beyond the usual slapdash use of the words "relevant" and "relevance," and
have attempted to explicate the concept further.  Both attempts only partially
succeed.  Konigova proposes three types:  formal relevance, subject/content
relevance and subjective relevance (or pertinency).  This classification has
validity, but is not further elaborated, and indeed she reverts to a less
precise language; for example, in defining "second order noise," she uses the
ambiguous phrase "a formally relevant document which is not really relevant" -
presumably meaning not subjectively relevant, according to the real need of
the enquirer.  And in her mathematics, as she admits, "no account is taken of
the subjective relevance (pertinence)."  Yet this is surely the true aim of the
system.

An Evaluation of Query Expansion by the Addition of Clustered Terms 
   for a Document Retrieval System
.A
Minker, Jack
Wilson, Gerald A.
Zimmerman, Barbara H.
.W
   An evaluation of graph theoretical clusters of index terms which can be 
extracted from an automatically indexed document collection, and the effects of 
employing such cluster in automatic document retrieval is described.. The graph 
theoretical cluster which were developed from six data base under two different 
cluster definition were analyzed for average size and related data.. The 
clusters were also used to expand the queries in each of six data bases to 
determine the effect of the expansions on the document retrieval results..
   Although a large variety of clusters and associated query explanations were
obtained, no significant improvements in the document retrieval performance 
were achieved.. In some cases, however, significant degradations in the 
retrieval performance occurred.. Although seemingly meaningful clusters can be
obtained, the results indicate that the effort involved in finding clusters 
and adding the clustered terms to queries is far to great to warrant their use
in an operational system.. The data bases employed were relatively small, and 
the  authors caution against generalizing these results to large data bases or 
other  situations..

Situational Relevance
.A
Wilson, Patrick
.W
   The concept of situational relevance is introduced, based on W.S.Cooper's
definitions of logical relevance, on the notion of evidential relevance drawn
from inductive logic, on the notions of a personal stock of knowledge and a set 
of personal concerns, the latter explained in terms of preferences over ranges 
of alternatives.. Situationally relevant items of information are those that 
answer, or logically help to answer, questions of concern.. Significant 
situationally relevant information is explained in terms of changes of view in 
relation to questions of concern.. It is claimed that situational relevance is 
an explication of the ordinary notion of practical relevance, and that it is 
the appropriate relevance concept to use in evaluation of systems supplying 
practically relevant information..

Selection of Equifrequent Word Fragments for Information Retrieval
.A
Schuegraf, E. J.
Heaps, H. S.
.W
   The design of programs to research large document data bases is discussed 
with regard to the use of compression coding combined with adoption of word 
fragments as the basic language elements.. An algorithm is described for 
determination of a set of almost equifrequent fragments.. Its efficiency is 
tested for a sample data base formed from the MARC tapes.. A certain threshold 
frequency acts as a parameter whose value determines the number of distinct 
fragments.. The selection algorithm is designed to give some preference to 
choice of the longest fragments and hence allow compact coding of the data base 
by concatenation of non-overlapping fragments..

Interaction Between Requesters and a Large Mechanized retrieval System
.A
Lancaster, F.W.
.W
   In a large mechanized retrieval system, a certain proportion of the search
failures are likely to be directly attributable to inadequate user-system 
interaction.. Request statements may be only distant  approximations of
actual information requirements.. This paper discusses some of the problems of
the user-system interface and suggests methods whereby these problems may be
alleviated..

The U.S. National Library of Medicine and International MEDLARS Cooperation
.A
Corning, Mary E.
.W
   The U.S. National Library of Medicine (NLM) initiated its computer-based 
bibliographic information storage and retrieval system, MEDLARS, in 1964..
Currently, The NLM has eight international MEDLARS quid-pro-quo arrangements 
with the United Kingdom, Sweden, France, West Germany, Japan, Australia, Canada
and the World Health Organization.. The policy aspects of the arrangements are
discussed as well as the organizational and operational characteristics of 
these non-U.S. MEDLARS Centers..

Information in 1985; a forecasting study of
information needs and resources
.A
Anderla, G.
.W
    The primary purpose of this study is to estimate the supply of,
and above all the demand for, scientific and technical information;
its secondary objective is to make a long-term assessment of
qualitative and quantitative requirements for information specialists.
In both instances, of course, future technical developments, as far
as they can be foreseen, must be taken into account.
    At the same time, like most work sponsored by the OECD, its aim
is to identify significant criteria for defining a policy - in this
case an information policy, which is greatly needed in all OECD countries.

Information Analysis and Retrieval
.A
Kent, A.
.W
    Therefore the purpose of this book remains the same as that of Textbook on
Mechanized Information Retrieval - to teach basics to those who have had no
previous exposure either to the field or to computers, or both.  Therefore,
the action is slowed to the point where the logical principles of information
retrieval systems are laid bare.  Other books have been published that emphasize
computer programming - this one does not.

Fuzzy Sets
.A
Zaden, L. A.
.W
   A fuzzy set is a class of objects with a continuum of grades of membership..
Such a set is characterized by a membership (characteristic) function which 
assigns to each object a grade of membership ranging between zero and one.. The
notions of inclusion, union, intersection, complement, relation, convexity, 
etc., are extended to such sets, and various properties of these notions in the
context of fuzzy sets are established.. In particular, a separation theorem for
convex fuzzy sets is proved without requiring that the fuzzy sets be disjoint..

Information and Its User
.A
Brittain, J.M.
.W
  In science and technology user studies are numerous and have a
history of some twenty years.  The relevance of the methodology
of science user studies to the social sciences is considered in 
Chapter 2.  The pressing need in user studies, in science as well
as social science, is for a general body of theory about the flow
of information in research and teaching communities.  Some of the
fundamental characteristics of social science research and its
literature which have a bearing upon investigations of information
needs and requirements are considered in the first part of Chapter
3, and the second part is devoted to a review of empirical studies
in the social sciences.  Other relevant material about the use made
of information is discussed in Chapter 4 on systematic approaches.

Information, Mechanism, and Meaning
.A
Mackay, D.M.
.W
  In a day when it is hard enough in most fields of science to
keep abreast of new and non-redundant literature, the
publication of collected papers, like the estate of holy
matrimony, is something not to be undertaken 'unadvisedly,
lightly or wantonly'.  In the present case it would not have been
considered at all but for the kindly initiative of my respected
friend Professor Roman Jakobson, whose persistent encouragement
alone overcame that distaste which most of us feel
for our ten- to twenty-year-old productions and brought this
first volume to the point of no return.  It is true that these
exploratory papers were scattered among an unconscionably 
awkward selection of publications for anyone wanting to
follow them up.  On the other hand, as most of them were
written for specific occasions, each of which demanded some
rehearsal of points covered in earlier essays, the resulting
repetitiveness presented a special problem.  With occasional
exceptions, redundancy could have been eliminated only
at the cost of mutilating individual papers.  The solution
adopted has been to leave almost all repetitive passages
intact, offsetting in small print those that can be skipped
without loss by readers of the earlier chapters.  Where some
comment has seemed necessary, by way of foreword or 
postscript to the original papers, the passages added have
been italicized.

Information Retrieval Systems
.A
Lancaster, F.W.
.W
  This book is concerned primarily with those "intellectual" factors that
significantly affect the performance of all information retrieval systems;
namely,

        - indexing policy and practice
        - vocabulary control
        - searching strategies
        - interaction between the system and its users

  My viewpoint is that of the evaluator of information systems.  I have
therefore paid considerable attention to a discussion of the requirements
of users of information systems and the measurement of system performance
in terms of the efficient and economical satisfaction of these requirements.
  The book does not concern itself, except indirectly, with equipment
for the implementation of retrieval systems, a topic that is adequately
covered by other volumes in this seris.  Moreover, it is my contention that
the importance of "hardware" and "data processing" aspects of information
systems has been exaggerated in the United States, with some detriment
to the performance of many systems.

Information Retrieval On-Line
.A
Lancaster, F.W.
.W
    This book deals with on-line systems for bibliographic search and
retrieval.  The literature on this subject is increasing rapidly and new systems
are appearing all the time.  We have attempted to provide a broad survey of
the characteristics, capabilities, and limitations of present systems.  Our
emphasis is on the design, evaluation, and use of on-line retrieval systems,
primarily from the viewpoint of the planner and manager of information
services.  It is oriented toward the "intellectual" aspects of information
retrieval rather than the hardware or programming aspects.  We hope that
this book may have some value for all students of library and information
science.

Information Retrieval and Documentation in Chemistry
.A
Davis, C.H.
.W
  For several years we have thought that greater effort should be
expended to create more understanding of the processes involved in
information storage, retrieval, and dissemination.  Too often, concepts
deriving from science and technology are made to seem unnecessarily
abstruse, either inadvertently or deliberately to preserve some sort of
mystique.  This book is intended to explicate, if not popularize, major
aspects of I S & R processes as they are exemplified by the field of
chemical documentation.  To the extent that this work is found useful
by chemists, information specialists, and all individuals interested in
scientific documentation, we shall be gratified.

Information Retrieval and Processing
.A
Doyle, L.B.
.W
    The present book embodies a change in structure and focus to reflect
the fact that the reader of today's book is much more likely to be an
interested college student with a great awareness of the current information
revolution than was the case ten years ago.  Thus, hardware, materials, and
processes used in connection with information systems are discussed first,
in Chapters Two through Four.  The subject of information retrieval per se
begins with Chapters Five and Six, which have to do with librarianship 
and documentation.  Because of their somewhat historical slant, these
chapters (along with Seven) are the only ones taken from the 1963 book
which adhere to their original character.  Chapter Seven presents a simplified
concept of an information system and its components, and paves the way for
discussion of computerized retrieval in the chapters to follow, especially
for data retrieval in Chapter Eight and document retrieval in Chapter Nine.
Chapters Ten through Twelve, on language processing, evaluation, and user
studies, describe important facets of the information retrieval field that have
developed strongly since 1963.

Van Rijsbergen, C.J.

  The material of this book is aimed at advanced undergraduate
information (or computer) science students, postgraduate library
science students, and research workers in the field of IR.  Some of the
chapters, particularly Chapter 6, make simple use of a little advanced
mathematics.  However, the necessary mathematical tools can be easily
mastered from numerous mathematical texts that now exist and in any
case references have been given where the mathematics occur.

Information Retrieval; British and American, 1876-1976
.A
Metcalfe, J.
.W
        Of eight chapters this first one deals with principles and
definitions and then with the slow development of information
retrieval through about 5,000 years until the introduction of
printing in Europe less than 500 years prior to our period
of principal coverage, 1876-1976.  This latter period coincides
with the second century of the United States of America,
during which were intensified earlier efforts to carry out one of
Washington's urgings in his Farewell Address:  "Promote
then, as an object of primary importance, institutions for the general diffusion
of knowledge."

Similarity Relations and Fuzzy Orderings
.A
Zaden, L. A.
.W
   The notion of "similarity" as defined in this paper is essentially a 
generalization of the notion of equivalence.. In the same vein, a fuzzy ordering
is a generalization of the concept of ordering.. For example, the relation 
x >> y is a fuzzy linear ordering in the set of real numbers..
   More correctly, a similarity relation, S is a fuzzy relation which is
reflexive, symmetric, and transitive..
   Various properties of similarity relations and fuzzy ordering are 
investigated and, as an illustration, an extended version of Szpilrajn's 
theorem is proved..

   An outline is given of the history of the Project and the development, with 
OSTI support, of an information service in intestinal absorption which is intended
to become self-supporting.. Results of an evaluation of computer-based current 
awareness techniques including journal scanning is discussed with reference to 
cost, completeness and minimum delay.. A simple technique is suggested for
profile construction e.g. for Chemical Titles computer search, based on 
frequency and specificity of words in a sample of relevant titles..

Analysis of On-line Searching Costs
.A
Robertson, S.E.
Datta, S.
.W
   A project was undertaken to discover the major determinants of the costs of 
searching, on-line, on a practical reference retrieval system (SCISEARCH).. The
methodology and some results of this project are reported.. Controlled searches
were undertaken to isolate the effect of each of a number of variables.. A 
model involving several of the major variables was then developed.. The general
approach proved to be (in this case) both feasible and useful..

Information Service in Libraries
.A
Crowley, T.
.W
        The two studies presented here represent efforts
to measure the performance of library staffs in an unobstrusive
fashion:  that is, to apply certain tests generally
similar to portions of the normal workload without drawing
attention to the fact that a test is being carried out.  The
two projects were rather different as to purpose, method,
and reliability of result (that is, statistical significance).
Dr. Crowley's investigation, the first in point of time,
arose partly from his experience in a county library.  His
curiousity about the real result of the reference activities
(as different from merely counting the questions answered)
led him to ask, "Is there substantial difference between the
claims made by librarians for reference work and the actual
result as observed in a number of different situations by
individuals posing as clients?"  The study which followed
from this question was, then, exploratory and necessarily
less rigidly controlled than was the second study of this
pair.

Information Storage and Retrieval:
tools, elements, theories
.A
Becker, J.
.W
  This textbook grew out of some discussions between the authors
about the interdisciplinary character of the field of information storage
and retrieval.  We both felt that the need existed to show what
each professional group concerned with the solution of information
storage and retrieval problems could contribute.  A university-level
course was developed, based on the concept that each person should
be made aware of how others could help him.  The course was presented
about a dozen times over the ensuing years, and this book is based on it.

ways and means of accomplishing this, and these methods of improving
the organization and retrieval of personal document collections are the
principal topics to be covered.  The book is addressed primarily to the
researcher in any subject field who desires to improve the index to his
document collection or start an index to his document collection but does
not quite know how to go about it.  An index is herein defined as a
systematic organization of a collection of documents or data.  There are
indexes to various types of document and data collections, and there are
various types of indexes.  Examples of familiar indexes are indexes to
individual books, to collections of books (the card catalog in a library),
to the contents of journals or periodicals (for example, the Reader's Guide
to Periodical Literature), to collections of facts (for example, a telephone
directory), or to numeric data (such as physical constants of a group
of compounds or numeric data collected in a questionnaire study).

Bibliographic Coupling  Extended in Time: Ten Case Histories
.A
Kessler, M.M.
.W
   The methods of bibliographic coupling were applied to 8186 papers in thirty-
five volumes of the Physical Review (Vol. 77, 1950 to Vol. 111, 1958).. The 
results are reported in the form of ten case histories.. Each case was chosen 
to illustrate a problem in information retrieval..

A Methodology for Test and Evaluation of Information Retrieval Systems
.A
Goffman, W.
Newill, V.A.
.W
  A recognition of the importance of useful evaluative techniques is an 
indirect or secondary result of the hugely expanded national investment in 
scientific research.  Such recognition has followed the expenditure of much time
and money on the development of information systems which utilize advances in
information handling and data processing (primarily computer-oriented) to
handle the "explosion" of recorded information.  Information scientists from
a typically diverse group of parent disciplines are now cooperating not only
to develop methodologies of evaluation of such systems, but to apply them.

Factors Affecting the Preferences of Industrial Personnel for Information
  Gathering Methods
.A
Rosenberg, Victor
.W
   A structured questionnaire was administered to professional personnel in 
industrial and government organizations, asking the subjects to rank eight 
information gathering methods according to their preference in given
hypothetical situation.. The subjects were then asked to rate the methods on a
seven point scale according to (a) ease of use and (b) amount of information 
expected.. The subjects were divided into two groups determined by their time
spent in research or research related activities.. The groups were designated
"research" and "nonresearch"..
   A statistical analysis of the data from 96 subjects (52 in research, 44 in
nonresearch) showed that no statistically significant differences were present 
in either the rankings or ratings between research and nonresearch personnel.. 
   The results of the study infer that the ease of use of an information
gathering method is more important than the amount of information expected for
information gathering methods in industrial and government, regardless of the 
research orientation of the users..

On the Articulation of Surrogates:  An Attempt at an Epistemological
Foundation
.A
Perreault, J.M.
.W
  There are two major purposes, in mind, for this gathering.  The first is the
most general that can be proposed for any gathering: the simple advantage of
bringing together those who have been at work on a single problem or at least
a small class of problems - especially when this problem has not previously
benefited from exclusive and thematic collaboration among its investigators.
To further such thematic collaboration, the formal presentations have been
scheduled no more than three each day, with time left after each presentation
for (formal) discussion here in the conference room, and with as much time as
possible - given the number of presentations - left free for informal 
discussion. 
  The second purpose is one of even greater necessity, in my opinion, though
one not so obvious as the first.  Over and above the hope for interchange of
what has already been thought out - in the form of personal contact, where
the presence of the originator of the system or theory can reinforce the
printed word in its usual and ineffable way - it is my hope that we will all
be able (especially in our informal discussions) to penetrate beyond mere
similarity and difference to the underlying philosophical bases of syntactic
relationship.

Some Remarks on Information Languages, Their Analysis and Comparison
.A
Soergel, D.
.W
    "The machine language [information language in our terminology D.S.]
should not be confused with the machine code: (Upenskii, 59:357).  In
Ranganathan's more general terms: There should be no confusion between the
idea plane and the notational plane.  Many difficulties in classification
arise from this confusion.  This paper is devoted mainly to problems on
the idea plane.
    "The IR-language I want to talk about, is the language in which the
information to be retrieved is formulated, i.e. a declarative sentence
language, not the imperative sentence language of the programmer-retriever"
(Bohnert in Samet, 62.1:10), that is, the information language should not
be confused with the programming language.  (To avoid misunderstandings
it would perhaps be better to say "descriptive" instead of "declarative"
and to state explicitly that in a descriptive sentence an imperative may
be described which is, however, not to be executed by the system but to
be retrieved by appropriate searches.)

Concept Organization for Information Retrieval
.A
Farradane, J.
.W
  All analysis of information for storage and of questions for effecting
retrieval must be in terms of concepts and the relations between them.
The concepts may be just words (descriptors), as in simple post-co-ordinate
keyword indexing systems, or they may be class-terms or other idea-groupings,
as in classifications.  The relations between concepts often appear to be
absent, but if more than one word is used in indexing or in a search there is
clearly an implicit relation between them in the mind of the indexer or
questioner, and other relations possible between the words would lead to
false drops.  Classification has traditionally been a method of organization
of concepts in which the relations between concepts are ostensibly displayed
in the form of groupings called classes.

Automatic Term Classifications and Retrieval
.A
Sparck-Jones, K.
Needham, R. M.
.W
   Recent research at the Cambridge Language Research Unit has been concerned 
with the application of the automatic classification techniques associated with 
the "theory of clumps" to document description obtained from the Aslib-Cranfield
project, and with the use of the resulting term classifications in retrieval..
A substantial program engine has been developed which computes similarities 
between pairs of terms on the basis of their occurrences and co-occurrences in 
document descriptions, and finds classes of terms with strong similarity 
connections by minimizing the cohesion between a potential clump and its 
complement; and which retrieves using single terms and/or term classes 
according to specification, and calculates recall and precision ratios for sets 
of requests.. Serious tests with different similarity and clump definitions and 
with different modes of using term classes are still in progress, so on 
definite conclusions about the value of this kind of classification are 
presented..

Some Structural Characteristics of Articulated Subject Indexes
.A
Armitage, Janet E.
Lynch, Michael F.
.W
   An articulated subject index is one in which logical transformations of 
natural language phrases containing prepositions or connectives are employed to 
organize the noun phrases as subject headings, with subordinate displays of the 
remainder of the phrases.. The best-known example of the articulated subject 
index is that to Chemical Abstracts..
   It has been shown that a well-defined transformation links the entry, as it 
appears in the index, with the original phrase, in natural order, as it was 
first compiled by the indexer.. A reverse transformation can be used to 
generate potential index entries from indexing phrases containing one or more 
prepositions or connectives..
   A simple model has been devised for the generation of articulated subject 
index entries from natural language indexing phrases which exclude infinitives
or words acting as gerunds or participles.. A sorting algorithm has also been 
developed, the purpose of which is to select those entries which lead to 
greatest organization in the index display..
   Deviations from the model in manually-produced indexes are described.. The 
potential value of certain of these characteristics in information retrieval 
is examined..

Integrated Information Processing and the Case for a National Network
.A
Dammers, H. F.
.W
   The various premises, which need consideration when developing a realistic 
and flexible information storage, retrieval and dissemination (ISRD) system, 
are discussed; their implication is illustrated with some examples from the 
development of the system at "Shell" Research, Sittingbourne..
   One of the factors which will affect the satisfactory performance of an ISRD
system is the ease with which relevant literature information not held in the 
system can be provided..
   The later part of the paper is developed to a discussion of this problem and
of a possible means of dealing with it in the not too distant future..

Some Experiments in the Selective Dissemination of Information
  in the Field of Plasma Physics
.A
Anthony, L. J.
Cheney, A. G.
Whelan, E.K.
.W
   A small-scale, computer-based SDI system in plasma physics and the related 
subjects is described briefly.. The system serves about 100 research scientists 
and engineers and uses title input only in order to minimize input costs.. The
implications of this approach and its effect upon the system parameters is
discussed.. Some comparison of the costs of the computer-based system with 
those of a manual system is made..
   Further experiments are described in which the service is expanded to 
external users on a world-wide basis, the aim being to compare, under controlled
conditions, the parameters of the small-scale internal service with those of an 
external service on a wide scale..
   The paper concludes with some observations on the future development and 
organization of computer-assisted services, their possibilities and the main 
problems which are likely to arise..

Performance of Automatic Information Systems
.A
Lesk, Michael E.
.W
   The SMART document retrieval system is used to investigate algorithms for
text analysis and request searching.. Results from three document collections 
indicate that word normalization is efficiently performed by automatic thesaurus
lookup, while phrase matching procedures, statistical association methods, and 
concept hierarchies are useful for special applications.. Automatic document 
clustering schemes and use-interactive feedback methods permit rapid searches of
large collections.. Abstracts are found to be superior to titles as a base for
content analysis in a document retrieval system and almost as good as complete
texts.. Proper procedures for designing dictionaries and searching requests
are discussed..The practicality of large scale document centers and their proper
design are considered in light of these results..

Negotiation of Inquiries in an On-Line Retrieval System
.A
Hillman, Donald J.
.W
The focus of discussion is a prototype retrieval system with three major 
components for text processing, connectivity and decision operations.. Each of
these components is based on a distinguishable subtheory..
   Computer programs for the first two components have been written for a GE 
225 computer.. The complete prototype system is now being programmed for 
operation in a time-shared environment.. It is a user-oriented system, with 
planned capabilities for the browsing and man-machine interaction..
A major goal is to develop procedures whereby research workers can conduct an 
on-line dialog via terminals with a body of scientific information.. Each 
user-submitted inquiry is a set of sentences without restriction as to 
vocabulary or form.. The system converses with the user to obtain 
source-derived phrases that elaborate and refine the initial inquiry.. The use is
led to browse in the general area of his inquiry and to broaden or narrow it as
a further aid to request formulation..
   Evaluation of system performance is described..

Relevance Assessments and Retrieval System Evaluation
.A
Lesk, M. E.
Salton, G.
.W
   Two widely used criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of information 
retrieval system are, respectively, the recall and the precision.. Since the 
determination of these measures is dependent on a distinction between documents 
which are relevant to a given query and documents which are not relevant to that
query, it has sometimes been claimed that an accurate, generally valid 
evaluation cannot be based on recall and precision measures..
   A study was made to determine that effect of variations in relevance 
assessments on the average recall and precision values used to measure 
retrieval effectiveness.. Using a collection of 1200 documents in information 
science for test purposes, it is found that large scale differences in the 
relevance assessments do not produce significant variations in average recall 
and precision.. It thus appears that properly computed recall and precision 
data may represent effectiveness indicators which are generally valid for many 
distinct user classes..

An Indirect Method of Information Retrieval
.A
Goffman, William
.W
   The information retrieval process, treated strictly as a matching procedure,
has the defects that tha whole file must be probed for each query, and that it
overlooks the fact that the relevance of the information from one document 
depends upon what is already known about the subject, and in term affects the 
relevance of other documents subsequently examined.. A mathematical model of a 
search technique in which the defects of the direct method are taken into account 
is demonstrated by an experiment in which a given paper is treated as an enquiry
and the references cited in the paper are treated as relevant answers.. The
results in two tests show much better results than those achieved by the direct 
method.. No spurious material was retrieved by either method..

The Use of Automatically-Obtained Keyword Classifications 
   for Information Retrieval
.A
Jones, K. Sparck
Jackson, D. M.
.W
   This report summarizes the work carried out on the automatic construction of
keyword classifications and their use in information retrieval that we have 
carried out in the last eighteen months.. It discusses the possible 
characteristics of such classifications, and potential ways of using them; and 
described the various approaches to classification we have considered, in terms
of an overall frame of reference in which several types of classification are 
distinguished.. The results of experiments using a collection of documents and
test requests obtained from the Aslib Clanfield project are presented, from 
which it can be conclude that automatic classifications which lead to noticeable
improvements in retrieval performance over those obtainable with unclassified 
terms can be set up..

Experiments in Book Indexing by Computer
.A
Borko, Harold
.W
   The most challenging task in preparing an index to a book is to select all 
and only those terms that are related to the text and are useful for relevance 
purposes.. While a knowledgeable human can make the selection on an intuitive 
basis, automatic indexing requires a precise operational criterion for defining 
and selecting good and useful index terms.. Two principles of selection are 
proposed:specification and selection of useful terms, and specification and 
exclusion of useless terms.. Because of the nebulous nature and meaning of
"good index terms", and the difficulties involved in devising machine algorithms
for their selection, this research in automatic indexing is based on the 
principle of excluding useless terms.. Even so,fully automatic indexing was not 
achieved in this study.. Single words proved to be little value as index terms..
Multiple word terms were generated by the computer, but no algorithm could 
successfully eliminate the useless phrases.. Final selection had to be made by 
the experimenter.. A comprehensive and useful book index was achieved by using 
machine-aided rather than fully automated indexing techniques..

Computer Use in Information and Data Handling: 
  an Appraisal of Its Economic Aspects
.A
Dammers, H. F.
.W
   The economic merits of applying computers in information storage, retrieval 
and dissemination have usually been considered with respect only to the cost of 
operating the information services concerned.. This had tended to indicate that
computer use is economically justified mainly for housekeeping operations in 
the large scale organizations..
   The present paper takes a wider view and included in its appraisal the costs
involved in information gathering and dissemination for the total system 
representing the information services and its users.. It is suggested that the 
inclusion of cost elements associated with user time devoted to information 
gathering tends to shift the economic appraisal in favor of computer application
in information work..
   In fact, such computer use appears to find its main stimulus and economic 
justification    in an environment that provides strong incentives to minimize 
the total cost of the system whilst maximizing its benefits to the users..
   To illustrate this some example are given based on experience gained in 
research data handling and the operation of SDI services in an industrial 
research establishment..

Performance and Cost of "Free-Text" Search systems
.A
Kent, A.K.
.W
  The purpose of an information-retrieval system is to provide the user with
citations relevant to his query.  Since the user is the only person competent
to make the final judgement of relevance it is natural to suppose that the
selection of items from a data base will lead to two kinds of retrieval
error.  The extent of these errors is expressed by the familiar measures
of performance, precision and recall.  Precision measures the failure of the
system to retrieve only relevant documents while recall measures its failure
to retrieve all relevant documents actually present in the data base.  It is
difficult to visualize a situation in which a user would find advantage in
being provided with irrelevant citations.  From the user's point of view,
therefore, a system which offers less than 100 per cent precision is a
deficient system.

Experimental Use of a Program for Computer-Aided Subject-Index Production
.A
Armitage, J.E.
Lynch, M. F.
Petrie, J. H.
Belton, M.
.W
   Stages in the development of a program for the production of articulated 
subject indexes are described.. The preparation of an index to the third 
edition of the SMRE Bibliography has enabled the technique to be assessed in a 
practical situation.. Titles from 1700 documents included in the bibliography 
were edited to provide input to the program, and the output recorded on a 
micro-film/hard-copy recorder in upper case alone..
   Further developments now in hand are indicated and criteria for assessing the 
suitability of the technique relative to other index-production techniques are 
discussed..

Optimum Procedures for Economic Information Retrieval
.A
Heaps, H. S.
Thiel, L. H.
.W
   Computer searches on Chemical Titles tapes for current awareness at the 
University of Alberta since May, 1968, have provided sufficient data to allow 
formulation of a cost function based on the number of titles searched, the 
length of questions, the extent to which questions may be batched, and certain 
details regarding the allowed forms of question.. With different choice of 
parameters the cost function could be adapted to apply to searches of other data 
bases..
   An attempt to make retrospective searching economically feasible has led to
formulation of different search techniques.. It is suggested that the search 
procedure should be designed to minimize computation time at the expense of 
convenience in the form of output, but that facilities should be included so 
that the user who is willing to play the additional cost may receive output in 
a more convenient form..
   In recognition of the fact that the form of search question should be 
dependent on the vocabulary of the data base, a program has been developed to 
modify a question so that it is optimal for searches on the given data base..

The Cost and Costing of Information Storage and Retrieval 
.A
Sessions, V.S.
.W
  This presentation on economic aspects of information retrieval is based
on data gathered by Project URBANDOC during the course of four years in
developing documentation services for the literature of urban planning
and renewal.  It was a substantial effort - half a million dollars is
no small sum in the social sciences - made possible by an Urban Renewal
Demonstration Grant from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development
(HUD) to The City University of New York.  The proposal that initiated the
Project in 1965 grew out of the extensive dissatisfaction with bibliographic
services in planning librarianship at a time when both planners and librarians
were looking to data processing to solve a variety of information problems.
URBANDOC was to apply the techniques of scientific documentation to a body of
literature which had been neglected by the information science community before
the advent of computerization, and completely by-passed by it afterwards.

grew up because of the need of the military and para-military establishments
to have rapid access to large quantities of scientific and technological
information.  This paper will deal with two complementary efforts in the
field of social sciences, where an awareness of the information problem is
acute, and the global needs staggering.  The target audiences for these two
systems are on the one hand social science researchers and on the other
policy planners and makers in the broad field of economic and social 
development.
  An operational system (in the International Labour Office) will be
described, and an array of figures representing actual or theoretical 
operating costs will be given.  As could be expected, however, these
figures relate only to costs of systems development, input preparation,
file maintenance and retrieval.  No attempt can be made to evaluate in other
than general terms the economic impact that the existence of such a system
may have.  It can be readily demonstrated, however, that computer-assisted
information systems may make sense within individual institutional
environments, and make greater sense when on-line systems linking
various collaborating institutions can result in enabling each to operate
more efficiently and at lower cost.  The existence of such on-line
networks would make the greatest sense for users because of the possibility
of having access at a reasonable price to large information stores.

   This paper reports the results of a practical study of the application of 
digital computers to the storage, analysis and retrieval of the full text of 
Acts of Parliament and associated delegated legislation dealing with automatic 
energy, a total of some 140,000 words.. A suite of computer programs has been 
prepared in a high-level language for generating a dictionary and concordance 
to the full text and organizing the search process.. The interrogation 
language QUEST is described and its application to full text searching 
discussed..

Experiments in Automatic Extracting and Indexing
.A
Earl, Lois L.
.W
   This article reports on several experiments in automatic extracting and one
experiment in automating indexing.. Nine chapters, each from a different 
technical book, were used as a text corpus for all the experiments.. In the 
first experiment, an attempt was made to construct a sentence dictionary of 
syntactic sentence types, for distinguishing extract-worthy sentences, but it 
proved unrewarding.. Nevertheless, the results indicated that sentence typing
might be used in a screening process in conjunction with other extracting 
techniques.. The later attempts to combine synactic and statistical criteria 
in the choice of extract sentences and index phrases proved more rewarding.. 
The sentences selected  by the extracting algorithm  were representative and 
are presented for the reader to peruse.. The noun phrases selected by the 
indexing algorithm compared favorably with the back-of-the-book index phrases..
There is every indication that satisfactory back-of-the-book indexes could be 
produced automatically, with post-editing to delete superfluous items..

Cost-Effectiveness as a Guide in Developing Indexing Rules
.A
Schultz, Claire K.
.W
   To date, the many decisions among alternatives that are required in the 
course of developmental efforts to improve indexing have, with few exceptions, 
been guided primarily by criteria related to effectiveness, as measured by some 
objective method, or as judged subjectively.. Although effectiveness-type 
criteria may be adequate for work intended solely to advance the 
state-of-the-art, when the goal is to develop indexing techniques appropriate 
for operating services, it seems highly desirable to employ some criterion that 
takes cost as well as effectiveness into consideration.. The central problem of 
operating services can be reduced to either that of producing the best indexing 
possible at a given cost, or that of producing indexing of a given level of 
effectiveness at least cost.. In our current effort to develop rules for human, 
machine, and man-machine indexing, we employ a cost-effectiveness type of 
criterion in making the critical developmental decision.. The general approach
is described  and illustrated with examples of how measures of cost and of 
effectiveness  were considered jointly in decision making, primarily for how to
reduce cost of indexing at a given level of effectiveness.. Problems of 
defining cost are also discussed, such as how to divide indexing into discrete 
steps, the effects of long-term vs. short-term activity in humans and 
small-batch vs. large-batch considerations for machines..

Compilation of Thesauri for Use in Computer Systems
.A
Rolling, L.N.
.W
  A thesaurus can be defined as a structured vocabulary for use in information
storage and retrieval systems.
  Three parts of this definition need further elaboration:
  1. A vocabulary is a collection of terms.
  2. The structure of a vocabulary can be described as a set of relationships
     between terms.
  3. Utilization of a thesaurus in an information system involves a set of
     rules which take into account the characteristics of the system.

Information-Seeking Behavior of Catalog Users
.A
Tagliacozzo, R.
Kochen, M.
.W
   This study is based on the data from a survey of catalog use at three 
university libraries and one public library.. Both "known-item" searches and
"subject" searches were analyzed.. The characteristics of the user population 
were examined and methodological problems of the survey were discussed.. A
relation was found between the academic rank of the catalog users and type of 
search that they carry out.. Some of the factors influencing the success or 
failure of the search were analyzed, and the meaning of "success" for the two
types of search was discussed.. The study investigated tends in search 
strategies as well as degree of perseverance of catalog searchers..Implications 
for the design of modern information retrieval systems were pointed out..

Automatic Classification and Retrieval of Documents by Means 
  of a Bibliographic Pattern Discovery Algorithm
.A
Schiminovich, S.
.W
   We present completely automatic procedures for the self-generation of 
meaningful groups among the members of a document collection and for the 
classification according to these groups of subsequent documents.. These
procedures operate on large document collections with reasonably short
computation times.. Thus far, in our experiments on the physics literature,
automatic classification has proven to be as good as or better than manual
indexing and, in addition, potentially less expensive.. Empirically derived, 
our method is based upon a pattern discovery algorithm which use only the 
citation content of a document and with operates on the bibliographic links 
among papers.. The self-generated groups correspond to very specific subject 
headings; retrospective bibliographies generated in the procedures allow one 
to classify the subsequent literature with remarkably high recall and 
relevance ratios, close to 100%..

Columbia University School of Library Service System 
  for Thesaurus Development and Maintenance
.A
Hines, T. C.
Harris, Jessica L.
.W
   A system for computer-based thesaurus production and maintenance has been 
developed at Columbia University School of Library Service.. The system is
highly flexible, providing for all the types of data elements which have been 
used in both thesauri and subject heading lists, with additional features found
to be useful as a result of the ongoing research program at Columbia.. Three
thesauri in widely varying subject fields are in the final stages of production
under the system.. As a result of the simultaneous development of the thesauri 
(based on actual indexing universes) and of the production system, which is 
part of a larger program of research in information handling problems, a variety
of new techniques and procedures have been developed as their usefulness became 
evident..

Five Years, Five Volumes and 2345 Pages 
  of the Annual Review of Information Science and Technology
.A
Saracevic, Tefko
.W
   The Annual Review of Information Science and Technology (ARIST) is now 5
years old.. In these 5 years ARIST became not only a very much used and quoted 
tool, but also an established institution.. This is testified by the fact that 
each of the five volumes was the year's most frequently and most comprehensively
reviewed book in the field.. The ARIST effort is unparalleled in great many 
fields..
   Currently we are entering an era of intense concern about and reactions to
science and technology.. All sciences and technologies are subject to 
questioning, scrutiny and evaluation both inside and outside of their subject 
areas..
   Scrutiny of a field may be attempted by a scrutiny of its important 
literature items.. With 5 years and five volumes ARIST invites and affords a 
perspective.. This review is attempting in broad brushstrokes to be a critical 
examination of the underlying structure, and literature base as well as the 
achievements of the ARIST effort as a whole..

A Technique for the Evaluation of a Commercial Information Service and Some
Preliminary Results from the Drugdoc Service of the 
Excerpta Medica Foundation
.A
Scott, E. J.
Townley, H. M.
Stern, B. T.
.W
   The selectivity, timeliness and quality of indexing of a commercial service 
may be assessed by comparing the journal articles chosen by an organization as 
relevant to its interests, with those subsequently reported by the service..
These aspects were evaluated with respect to Drugdoc which scans over 3400
biomedical journals.. The results showed that the selection criteria laid down 
by Drugdoc are strictly adhered to; the mean time of alerting of an article 
was 11-3 weeks after receipt of the journal at Wellcome and all articles from a
particular journal issue were reported by Drugdoc on average within 13-6 
weeks.. Indexing was examined in detail and on average 8-1 primary 
thesaurus-controlled indexing terms were assigned per article.. Pilot studies
were also run on SDI profiles compiled from the Drugdoc Thesaurus..

A Multidisciplinary and Computerized SDI Service for Industry and 
Research-Practical Experience and Costs
.A
Hisinger, B.
.W
   In this paper the experiences, costs, price policy, market, sales promotion
and foreign cooperation of a Danish documentation department are described in
relation to two databases, as follows: The COMPENDEX tapes are scanned in
Denmark, whereas the INSPEC tapes are scanned in Holland with the inclusion of
Danish profiles according to a bilateral agreement.. The total costs in 
connection with COMPENDEX are evaluated and divided into four main components:
Disbursement to the supplier of the tape system, working expenses of the 
documentation center, costs of the electronic data processing, and expenses
connected with the procurement of the original material to the subscribers..
They can choose between including or deleting the COMPENDEX abstracts during
sequential text scanning and printing-out.. Search profiles are formed by the 
terms (word, author, journal code) connected by AND/OR/NOT-logic and weight
factors.. (The above documentation department belongs to the National 
Technological Library of Denmark and also two SDI services based on tape 
systems from CAS.. Retrospective searches have been carried out)..

Interactive Reference Retrieval in Large Files
.A
Carville, M.
Higgins, L. D.
Smith, Francis J.
.W
   We express the conviction that on-line reference retrieval will largely 
replace the present tape driven system in a few years.. We describe the design
criteria of such an on-line system based on our experience of a pilot system 
which has been operational for 2 years, emphasizing the importance of
minimizing the number of disk accesses.. We recommend the use of hash coding 
for searching in a thesaurus and point out that the user of an on-line system 
should use the most precise terms first and the common terms last - the 
opposite of the procedure in a manual search..

The Use of Hierarchic Clustering in Information Retrieval
.A
Jardine, N.
Van Rijsbergen, C. J.
.W
   We introduce information retrieval strategies which are based on automatic
hierarchic clustering of documents.. We discuss the evaluation of retrieval
strategies and show, using a subset of the Cranfield Aeronautics document 
collection, that cluster-based retrieval strategies can be devised which are as 
effective as linear associative retrieval strategies and much more efficient..
Finally, we outline how cluster-based retrieval may be extended to large growing
document collections and indicate some ways in which the effectiveness of
cluster-based retrieval strategies may be improved..

Retrieval Efficiency from Titles and the Cost of Indexing
.A
Tell, Bjorn V.
.W
   By the means of the flexible machine search system three experiments have 
been made in order to test the retrieval efficiency of searching free text and 
keywords.. Base upon the relevance judgements of the users, the results 
indicate that titles and abstracts are good index material which can be used 
for machine searching without human indexing in the three fields studies..

Program Design for Retrospective Searches on Large Data Bases
.A
Thiel, L. H.
Heaps, H. S.
.W
   Retrospective search of large document data bases requires development of 
special techniques for automatic compression of data and minimization of the 
number of input-output operations to the computer accessible files.. Also, the 
computer program should be designed to require a relatively small amount of 
internal memory..
   The present paper contains a description of the structure of a program that 
meets the above requirements.. The vocabulary of the data base is automatically 
expressed in terms of 8, 16 and 24 bit codes chosen to point to the natural 
spelling in a dictionary.. Thus file size is reduced without the necessity for
extensive processing for decoding.. Use of a compressed bit string inverted
index greatly reduces search time, and a storage management system enables long
strings to be processed with use of a limited amount of internal storage..
Creation of "reduced" files and tables is an important feature of a program; it
allows the files needed only by specific phases of the program to be designed 
to use a relatively small amount of internal storage and input-output time..

Experiences of IIT Research Institute in Operating a Computerized Retrieval
System for Searching a Variety of Data Bases
.A
Williams, Martha E.
.W
   The Computer Search Center (CSC) at IIT Research Institute (IITRI) provides
information from computer-readable data bases to users in industry, government
and universities.. The center was designed to meet user needs by providing a 
variety of services from multiple data bases with minimal restrictions and a
high degree of flexibility.. A new modular machine-independent PL/1 software
system was developed for handling virtually any bibliographic-type base.. CSC
have run at nine different computer facilities with different: hardware,
computer models, versions of OS, peripherals of the PL/1 compiler.. All data
bases are converted by preprocessors to a standard IITRI format which employs
a directory and character string type of the structure..
   User oriented profile features include: full free form Boolean logic with 
any degree of nesting; search terms may be any data element on a data base; 
search terms may be single words, multi-word terms, phrases, or term fragments;
full truncation capabilities; optional sort of author, citation number, or 
weight; and optional printing of output on 5x8 cards, multilith masters, paper,
or tape.. User aids were developed for each data base to assist in profile and
monitoring.. They include: search manuals, truncation guides, term frequency 
list and KLIC indexes..
   Research is conducted and statistics maintained to study, monitor, and 
improve Center components including data bases, user satisfaction, systems,
personnel functions and services.. The many advantages of computerized 
retrieval, which are the raison d'etre for the center, include: coverage,
thoroughness, consistency, interdisciplinariness, recall, speed, regularity,
file preparation and cost effectiveness..

Communication and Information Processing within Scientific Disciplines:
Empirical Findings for Psychology
.A
Garvey, William D.
Griffith, Belver C.
.W
   Scientific disciplines can be regarded as social devices which have, as one
function, the analysis and reduction of raw information to assimilated 
knowledge of a type which can be transmitted through professional training..
Data on information flow in psychology reveal feedback to scientific workers
and result in refinements of the product of research; later disseminations are 
interwoven with processes of evaluation and selection and are directed toward 
the creation of an integrated and tested body of knowledge.. The reported data 
finish an empirical base for Ziman's consensual model of science and illuminate 
difficulties which have arisen in the design and implementation of information 
systems..

Evaluating the Effectiveness of an On-Line, 
Natural Language Retrieval System
.A
Lancaster, F. W.
Rapport, Rochard L.
Penry, J. Fiffin
.W
   An evaluation of an on-line retrieval system known as EARS (Epilepsy 
Abstracts Retrieval System) has been performed.. The system, which permits the 
free text searching of approximately 8000 abstracts drawn from Epilepsy 
Abstracts, is supported by the National Institute of Neurological Diseases and 
Stroke (NINDS).. Specialists in the field of neurology, at six medical centers
in the United States, conducted on-line searches to satisfy their own needs for 
information.. Parallel searches were conducted on the same search topics by a 
neurologist at NINDS who was highly experienced in using the system.. The 
results of the original searches were evaluated in terms of recall, precision, 
and general user satisfaction.. A detailed analysis of factors affecting  the
success and failure of the on_line searches was carried out..

A Journal Selection Model and Its Implications for a Library System
.A
Kraft, D. H.
Hill, T. W. Jr.
.W
   The problem of selecting which journals to acquire in order to best satisfy 
library objectives is modeled as a zero-one linear programming problem and 
examined in detail.. The model incorporates an objective function based on 
expected usage as a measure of journal worth and cost constraints which 
account for the scarcity of capital.. The model can be used to aid the 
librarian in making better selection decisions, since the objective function 
can be shown to reflect the evaluation of the library as an information 
retrieval system and as a service organization.. Moreover, the model of seen to 
be related to inventory problems and scheduling models in industrial 
operations.. 
   Journal usage is discussed as a measure of journal worth and is contrasted 
to journal productivity.. Constraints are considered for scarce resources other 
than capital and for journal interrelationships..

Problems in Information Retrieval: 
 Logical Jumps in the Expression of Information
.A
Farradane, J.
Russel, J. M.
Yates-Mercer, P. A.
.W
   In a structured data base, such as that obtained when information is indexed
in a format including explicit relations, retrieval of all relevant items in
response to a question may, in some cases, be restricted by technicalities of 
the structure.. Condensations in the form of logical jumps, or the omission of 
a concept with one relation out of a string of three concepts with two 
interstitial relations, have been investigated by two different methods, in 
order to overcome one of these technicalities.. Thirty-two rules are proposed
which could permit the automatic condensation of either of both the stored 
information and the question, when the concepts and relations are in the form 
of linear or string display.. Nine rules are proposed for condensation of 
angular structures.. Other type of logical jump and abbreviation are discussed, 
together with related studies of expansions and inference steps..

Machine_Aided Indexing of Technical Literature
.A
Klingbiel, Paul H.
.W
   To index successfully in the Defense Documentation Center's environment, an
automated system must chose single words or phrases (dependent upon context)
rapidly and economically.. The automation of DDC's indexing has been 
machine-aided from its inception.. A machine-aided indexing (MAI) system is 
described that indexes one million words of text per hour of CPU time.. 
Grammatical errors do not exceed five per cent of the output, so human 
screening is satisfactorily low.. The system could potentially scale up to an
operational size of 10 million words of text per year - the equivalent of a
dozen bibles or a third of the Encyclopedia Britannica.. In a batch mode, the
programs to accomplish this indexing would require no more than fifteen minutes
of CPU time per week..

A Bayesian Approach to Interactive Retrieval
.A
Tague, Jean M.
.W
   This paper presents a probabilistic model for interactive retrieval.. 
Specifically, it applies the principles of Bayesian statistical decision theory:
(1) the use of both prior (subjective) and sample information about the
relationship of document descriptions to query relevance, and (2) maximization 
of the expected value of a utility function, to the problem of optimally 
restructuring a search strategy in an interactive environment..

Distance between Sets as an Objective Measure of Retrieval Effectiveness
.A
Heine, M. H.
.W
   A general measure of retrieval effectiveness having full metric properties 
and treating the "retrieval system - arbiter of relevance"situation 
symmetrically, is the Marczewski-Steinhaus metric, D, measuring the distance 
between the set of relevant documents, A, and set of retrieved documents, B, 
according to D = 1 -(n (A ^ B)/n(A u B)).. D can be expressed as a function of 
Presicion and Recall, or of Generality, Fallout and Recall, and of other sets 
of traditional measures.. Acceptance of the measure allows criteria for 
retrieval optimality and degeneracy to be stated, defined by minimum and 
constant  values of D respectively.. Precision_Recall degeneracy curves for D 
are given and compared with those for another general measure: the probability
that a document will be correctly identified by a retrieval system.. 
Statistical extensions of D are examined, and these and other properties of the
metric are illustrated with seven examples..

CA Condensates as a Retrospective Search Tool	A Commentary
.A
Hansen, Inge Berg
.W
   A retrospective test search on 1 year of CA Condensates was carried out in 
order to calculate the cost per profile and to get an impression of how CA 
Condensates would suffice as a database for a retrospective use.. Some means of
improving the search strategy by means of the CAS Standard Distribution Format
were investigated.. The question is raised whether the costs and efforts 
presently devoted to research regarding retrospective searches on large 
free-text databases are justified in view of the low average precision ratios 
generally observed for free text databases and the very high number of 
references of potential interest retrieved..

Compression of Bibliographic Files Using an Adaptation of Run-Length Coding
.A
Lynch, Michael F.
.W
   Substantial degrees of compression of bibliographical data bases result from
the application to them a modified form of run-length coding.. The method
involves attenuation of the zero:one bit ratio of the data base.. This can be 
achieved by substitution of codes with the highest zero:one ratios the most
frequent symbols, or by substitution of 2-bytes codes for diagrams.. A form of
run-length coding in which the run-length is represented as a fixed-length
binary number is then applied..

Automatic Indexing and Generation of Classification Systems by Algorithm
.A
Hoyle, W. G.
.W
   A system of automatic indexing based on Baye's theorem is described 
briefly.. In assigning 124 documents to 9 categories, there were 97 cases of 
agreement with professional indexers.. Using a collection factor, based on 87 
per cent human consistency from other courses, the computer appears then to 
index with 90 per cent accuracy in this case..
   The technique is then used with two randomized sample document groups drawn
from nine categories.. Each group in turn is used as the basis for indexing the
other.. The computer knows only the number of categories.. After 8 cycles the 
computer is found to have formed 9 groups consisting of about 50 per cent of 
documents that were also lumped together by professional indexers on the basis 
of subject content..
   A new measure of performance is proposed and some other applications of the 
technique indicated..

The Cost_Performance of an On-Line, Free-Text Bibliographic Retrieval System
.A
Katzer, Jeffrey
.W
   The cost-performance evaluation of the SUPARS system is reported.. SUPARS 
was an on-line, free-text bibliographic  retrieval system; cost-effectiveness 
data of such systems are not readily available.. In our evaluation, two 
measures of cost were employed: a computer processing charge expressed in 
dollars, and the number of documents retrieved (a measure of work that must be 
expended to review the retrieved items).. The measure of performance was an 
estimate of the recall ratio..
   To obtain the requisite measures an experimental plan was developed in which 
experts searched the data base of Psychological Abstracts forming their queries
from written statements of information needs.. These statements (along with the 
list of documents relevant to them) were produced by people with information
problems.. Tallies were kept of the number of documents retrieved before each 
of the designed relevant items were found.. The major findings are noted 
below..
   (1) Queries to the system employing simple Boolean operators (AND, OR) have
better cost-performance characteristics than queries using more elegant 
searching operators..
   (2) On-demand access to the index or dictionary contributes sizeably to
improving the cost-performance of the system..
   (3) The argument is raised that human factors, such as the differences among
users of a system, probably should be a major factor in the design, operation 
and evaluation of retrieval systems.. It appears that consideration of these 
factors will improve system cost-performance..

Analysis of the Microstructure of Titles in the INSPEC Data-Base
.A
Lynch, Michael F.
Petrie, J. Howard
Snell, Michael J.
.W
   A high degree of constancy has been found to exist in the microstructure of 
titles of samples of the INSPEC data-base taken over 3-year period.. Character
and diagram frequencies are shown to be relatively stable, while variable-length
character-string characterizing samples separated by 3 years in time show close
similarities..

On the Role of Subjectivity in Establishing, Using, Operating and Evaluating
Information Retrieval Systems
Treatise II on Retrieval System Theory
.A
Fugman, Robert
.W
   The personal literature search of a scientist is strongly governed by
subjective influences.. If he delegates his literature search he should always 
be aware of the problems necessarily emanating from his subjective view.. This
prevents him from imposing unsatisfiable demands on the delegated search,
particularly with respect to its expected performance, and makes him conscious
of the fact that in order to satisfy his entire information need he cannot 
dispense with the browsing serendipity of his personal literature search.. He
will also better understand the peculiarities of the documentary methods needed
for operating large and continuously growing systems as compared with the 
methods sufficient for his personal file..
   The information scientist on the other hand, in charge of establishing, 
operating, and evaluating retrieval systems of high performance and survival 
power, should take into consideration the pronouncedly subjective character of
fundamental notions such as "information" and "order".. This gives him a better
understanding of the kind of inquiries submitted to him and of the inherently,
even if latently, subjective character of several fundamental operations in 
storage and retrieval and will cause him to refrain from futile attempts to 
make such operations more "objective" and formal.. Such a better mutual
understanding will be bound to promote advance in methodology and psychology of 
scientific communication..

On-Line Information retrieval as a Scientists Tool
.A
Barber, Stephanie A.
Barraclough, Elizabeth D.
Gray, W. Alexander
.W
   The use of an on-line information retrieval system by the scientists 
themselves is described.. MEDUSA was designed to allow physicians to 
interrogate the MEDLARS data base.. A brief description is given of the system 
and details of an experiment to test its effectiveness.. Search formulation 
prepared on-line by medical research workers are compared for recall and 
precision with the same requests formulated by search editors in the normal 
way.. The results show that physicians can use an on-line system effectively..

A Technique for Machine-Aided Indexing
.A
Klingbiel, Paul H.
.W
   Subject indexing of text can, in principle, be accomplished in many ways.. 
The technique for machine-aided indexing (MAI) developed at the Defense 
Documentation Center (DDC) is illustrated on a randomly chosen abstract..
Additional text is provided in coded form so that the reader can more fully
explore this technique and form his own opinion of the applicability and 
versatility of this particular procedure.. The DDC method for subject indexing 
is very close to operational status for a data base which grows at the rate of 
two million words of text per year..

Customized User Services via Interactions with LEADERMART
.A
Hillman, Donald J.
.W
   LEADERMART is a fully operational information retrieval system featuring 
on-line interactive service  to a wide variety of user groups in business,
industry, government, and universities.. With the availability of many
computer-readable bibliographic data bases, experience with users dictated the 
development of special-purpose information products based on a thorough 
understanding of individual client needs, and the delivery of such products in 
a customized form.. Each different application required a different package, 
with variations of both software and data base coverage.. These packages were
developed via suitable modification of modular system software to result in 
products tailored to user idiosyncracies..
   The paper describes problems associated with these repackaging procedures, 
and discusses the changes brought about by the introduction of an on-line, 
interactive retrieval service into the operating environment of users.. 
Implications for networking and resource-sharing, focusing upon 
cost-effectiveness and performance measures, are also discussed..

A Remote-Terminal Retrospective Search Facility Using a Hybrid of Microform
and Computer Storage
.A
Irvine, J. J.
.W
   This paper describes a technical document center providing remote-terminal
retrospective search capability and shows its evolution from the traditional 
catalog card operation..
   The system uses mini-computers for on-line input and editing of data and for
production of announcements, and uses a commercial computer-utility/
communication network for retrospective searching.. A hybrid of microform and 
computer storage was designed to decrease computer and line charges and to allow
for security considerations..
   Bilingual search capability in either of two models suitable for experienced
users or novices is provided to a network of satellite libraries separated by 
as much as 3000 miles..
   A Selective Dissemination of Information service is provided using in-house 
and foreign data bases and serving over 600 profiles of interest..

Indexing Language Structure for Automated Retrieval
.A
Wall, R. A.
.W
   A proposal for a computer-aided method of building up an indexing language 
is made.. The method involves linking the terms relevant to any special 
retrieval system into the UDC, preferably in the form of the Standard Reference
Code when it becomes available.. Links between the terms are intended to be 
established in such a way that, provided indexing input sessions are 
accomplished via a video terminal, a hybrid thesaurus-classification could be 
built up by a form of "learning process" in the course of regular indexing.. 
The proposed means of establishing links between terms are described, the
associated computer system is outlined, and an example of indexing language
built-up procedure is presented.. Possible uses for natural language search, 
using the thesaurus-classification as a "switching language", and for automatic
classification, are suggested as long-term aims..

Index Term Weighting
.A
Jones, Karen Sparck
.W
   Various approaches to index term weighting have been investigated.. In
particular, claims have been made for the value of statistically-based
indexing in automatic retrieval systems.. The paper discusses the logic of 
different types of weighting, and describes experiments testing weighting 
schemes of these types.. The result show that one type of weighting leads to
material performance improvements in quite different collection environments..

Relevance, Pertinence and Information System Development
.A
Kemp, D.A.
.W
   The different between pertinence and relevance is discussed.. Other pairs of
terms and the differences between their members are examined, and the 
suggestion is made that such studies could increase our understanding of the 
theory of information systems, and hence lead to practical improvements.. Some
examples are considered, among them the use of "personality profiles" to 
improve the pertinence effectiveness of systems..

The Dynamic Scientific-Information User
.A
Garvey, William D.
Tomita, Kazuo
Woolf, Patricia
.W
   In this article we examine the concept of the "information user", and 
attempt to describe some of the dynamics of the situation by discussing some of
our data relative to "intraindividual variations" (changes which occur within
individual scientists as their scientific work progresses) and "interindividual
variations" (physical vs social scientists, basic vs applied scientists, 
experienced vs inexperienced scientists, and scientists' working in the same
subject-matter area vs scientists who recently changed their areas).. All of
these were found to produce significant variation in the information needs of 
scientists and in the sources they used to satisfy these needs.. Some 
implications of these findings relative to information technology are 
discussed..

Reintjes, J. Francis
.W
   A comprehensive review of the experimental information storage and retrieval 
system developed by Project Intrex is presented, together with a description of
major results and conclusions that were derived through use of the system.. 
Salient features of the Intrex system included an argumented catalog stored in
an online interactive computer in combination with full-text storage on 
microfiche.. Guaranteed access to full text at remote allocations was provided
through use of an automatic fiche storage and retrieval system that was
computer-controlled.. Discussed in the paper are the details of the catalog 
structure, user experiments, economic studies and information-system 
networking..

Information Theory and Reliable Communication
.A
Gallagher, R.G.
.W
  This book is designed primarily for use as a first-year graduate text in
information theory, suitable for both engineers and mathematicians.  It is
assumed that the reader has some understanding of freshman calculus and
elementary probability, and in the later chapters some introductory random
process theory.  Unfortunately there is one more requirement that is harder
to meet.  The reader must have a reasonable level of mathematical maturity
and capability for abstract thought.  The major results of the theory are
quite subtle and abstract and must sometimes be arrived at by what appears to
be rather devious routes.  Fortunately, recent simplifications in the theory
have made the major results more accessible than in the past.

Information Retrieval Systems
.A
Lancaster, F.W.
.B
1972
.W
  This book is concerned primarily with those "intellectual" factors that
significantly affect the performance of all information retrieval systems;
namely,
    - indexing policy and practice
    - vocabulary control
    - searching control
    - interaction between the system and its users
    My viewpoint is that of the evaluator of information systems.  I have
therefore paid considerable attention to a discussion of the requirements
of users of information systems and the measurement of system performance
in terms of the efficient and economical satisfaction of these requirements.
    The book does not concern itself, except indirectly, with equipment
for the implementation of retrieval systems, a topic that is adequately
covered by other volumes in this series.  Moreover, it is my contention that
the importance of "hardware" and "data processing" aspects of information
systems has been exaggerated in the United States, with some detriment
to the performance of many systems.

A universal scheme served as the basis for classifying information retrieval
languages.
The book analyses in detail universal scheme similarities and differences
between natural and information retrieval languages; some ways of constructing
information retrieval language are discussed.

ISBD(S) and Title Main Entry for Serials
.A
Spalding, C. Sumner
.W
  At the IFLA Liverpool Conference in 1971 a Joint working
Group of the Committees on Cataloguing and on Serial Publications
was set up to draw up an International Standard Bibliographic
Description for Serials, taking the ISBD(M) as a model in
so far as practicable.  As might be expected, the special problems
presented by serial publications made the task of developing an
ISBD(S) a difficult assignment which the Joint Working Group
tackled with great energy and devotion.  The successive drafts
were prepared by the Chairman and the Secretary, Mlle M.-L.
Bossuat and Mlle M. Pelletier.
  Probably no data element presented such a severe problem as
that of serial title.  The seemingly countless Mitteilungen,
Memoires, Proceedings, Bulletins, Trudy's, and the like seemed to 
demand some useful and standardized way to be identified.  A
solution to this problem was found in the adoption of a device
which consisted of marrying the author statement to the generic
title proper, with a wedding ring consisting of a space-hyphen-
space and dubbing the happy couple the "distinctive title."

(Towards a Theory of the Concept)
.A
Dahlberg, I.
.W
  A concept is regarded as the common element of
both classification systems and thesauri.  Reality
and knowledge are not represented by words or
terms but by the meanings "behind" these tokens.
A concept of, say, an object, a property of an
object, a process, etc. is derived from verbal 
statements on these as subjects and may therefore be
defined as the whole of true and possible predicates
that can be collected on a given subject.  It is
from these predicates that the characteristics of the
corresponding concepts can be derived.  Common
characteristics in different concepts lead to
relations between concepts, which relations in turn are
factors for the formation of concept systems.
Different kinds of relationships as well as different
kinds of concepts are distinguished.  It is pointed
out that an orderly supply of the elements for 
propositions (information statements) on new knowledge
requires the construction and availability of such
concept systems.

Impact of Scientific Serials on the Advancement of Medical
Knowledge:  An Objective Method of Analysis
.A
Sengupta, I.N.
.W
  A common tool for the selection of serial publications for a research
library is the lists of most cited serials.  The possibilities of this method
were first studied by Gross and Gross who in 1927 applied a method of
sample statistical investigation to the grading of scientific serials
according to their relative importance based on citation counting from source
journals.

The Nature of Scientific Communication and Influence
.A
Crane, Diana
.W
   As the formal communication system of science has become less able to
supply information with the rapidity that scientists require, increasing
attention has been paid to the structure of communication in science.. How are
scientific publications utilized by scientists? What is accomplished by the
circulation of scientific information on an informal basis? How does the social
organization among scientists facilitate or inhibit these processes?
   Three types of studies have been conducted in this area: (a) studies of the
scientific literature itself; (b) studies of how scientists obtain the 
information which they need for their research; and (c) studies of the
relationship between scientists who conduct research in the same areas.. For the
most part, studies of formal communication and information gathering have been
conducted in the absence of all but the most rudimentary theoretical models, as
has been pointed out in at least three recent reviews of these studies (Libbey
and Zaltman, 1967, p. 64; Paisley, 1968; Storer, 1968, p. 12).. The lack of
theory can be attributed partly to the practical orientation of many of the 
studies and also to the fact that an adequate model cannot be based on any one
of these types of studies alone.. A useful theory must integrate knowledge from
all three types.. In this article, we will review these studies and will 
describe a teoretical model which has been designed to fill this purpose..

The Literature of the Social Sciences: a Survey of Citation Studies
.A
Broadus, Robert N.
.W
   The great concern with scientific communication in the last few decades has 
produced a number of studies analyzing the use of information.. One approach to
these matters has been via the citation study - a method often used in the physical 
sciences, but applied less frequently in the humanities and social sciences..
However, in the latter area, enough citation studies have been completed to 
produce material for interesting comparisons..

Interactive Bibliographic Search:
The User/Computer Interface
.A
Walker, D.E.
.W
    On the 14th and 15th of January, 1971, a Workshop on "The User
Interface for Interactive Search of Bibliographic Data Bases" was held at
Ricky's Hyatt House in Palo Alto, California.  The Workshop, sponsored by
the Information Systems committee of the American Federation of
Information Processing Societies, brought together a group of information
scientists who have been directly involved with this subject area.  They were
provided in advance with a "Challenge" paper and with a number of papers
prepared in response to that challenge.  The Workshop sessions themselves
were devoted exclusively to focussed discussions of the material and of the
problems in and the prospects for more effective systems design of the user
interface.  The content of these two days of deliberation prompted making
the substance of the Workshop experience available to a larger audience.
This book is intended to accomplish that goal.

    The Lister Hill National Center for Biomedical Communications of
the National Library of Medicine, in conjunction with the NLM Library
Operations staff, initiated in June 1970 a new experimental service called
AIM-TWX (Abridged Index Medicus-TWX) to provide rapid, responsive
searching of the medical literature.
    This experiment is being conducted to identify the need for and
usefulness of such services to help medical practitioners situated in isolated
areas, to assist in undergraduate, graduate, and continuing medical education,
and to provide information precisely when and where it is needed for health
care.  A limited group of practitioners, students, and librarians is being given
access to the system so that it will not be overloaded and rejected because of
busy signals, and so that a variety of user groups can test it.

  University printing presses exist, and are subsidized by the Government for
the purpose of producing books which no one can read; and they are true to their
high calling.  Books are the sources of material for lectures.  They should be
kept from the young; for to read books and remember what you read, well
enough to reproduce it, is called 'cramming', and this is destructive of all 
true education.  The best way to protect the young from books, is, first, to 
make them in such a way that no one can find them without several years' 
training.  A lecturer is a sound scholar, who is chosen to teach on the ground
that he was once able to learn.  Eloquence is not permissible in a lecture; it
is a privilege reserved by stature for the Public Orator.

The Intergroup Conflict
.A
Sherif, M.
.W
    In one broad category of theories, the problems are expressed
in terms of actualities of events in group relations as they
exist in everyday life.  On the whole, theories advanced by
many social scientists fall in this broad category.  In this
concern over actualities the problem is frequently not stated and
discussion not developed in a way that can be tested rigorously.
In the second broad category of theories, problems are stated
and analysis carried out in terms of more rigorous-appearing
concepts and units of analysis.  Theories coming from psychologists
and social scientists heavily influenced by them fall within
this broad category.  In this line of approach, theories are
advanced without due regard to actualities, and consequently
they are plagued with serious questions of validity.

Interlibrary Loan Involving Academic Libraries
.A
Thomson, S.K.
.W
  Interlibrary loan transactions involving academic libraries in the United
States numbered over 800,000 items in 1963-64.  This number is growing
exponentially.  Large libraries report that they cannot fill about a third
of the interlibrary loan requests they receive.  Unfilled interlibrary loans
are costly to both the borrowing and the lending libraries and reduce the
usefulness of the service to the reader.  Many of these interlibrary loan
failures are preventable, chiefly by publishing policies of the lending
libraries to prevent borrowers from requesting noncirculating materials and
by determining in advance what library owns the item wanted.

Interlibrary Loan Policies Directory
.A
Thomson, S.K.
.W
    In 1972-73 approximately 194,000 interlibrary loan requests
were not filled because the borrowing library in ignorance
requested non-circulating material contrary to the
interlibrary lending policies of the lending library.  These
unfilled requests probably cost the borrowing and lending
libraries over $400,000 in wasted manpower, besides 
disappointing readers who waited in vain for their materials.
Much of this waste could be prevented if borrowing libraries check
in advance the lending policies before sending requests.
    The major elements determining whether or not libraries
receive requests to borrow from libraries at a distance are
whether the library lists unusual materials in union lists,
especially THE NATIONAL UNION CATALOG, THE UNION LIST OF
SERIALS AND NEW SERIAL TITLES, and whether it has strong
collections in a subject field listed in library directories.
Volume of out-of-state lending is related to the type of
lending library, the size of collection, budget for current    
acquisitions, number of periodicals received, photocopy
charges, population density in neighboring states, proximity
to other libraries, and completeness of reporting holdings in
the National Union Catalog or other bibliographic centers.

Interlibrary Requests
.A
Ash, L.

  Our survey, in other words, is offered within the bounds of descriptive
or deductive statistics which seeks to analyze a group, not attempt to estimate
the parameters of that population of which the group has been chosen as a
sample.  The latter role is assumed by inductive statistics which makes use
of probability sampling. Accordingly, our data are presented in those forms
and with those statistical measures appropriate to the methods of descriptive
statistics: arrays, frequency distributions, breakdowns by categories which
seem of optimum value to the librarian and administrator, e.g., the frequency
of requests for journals versus monographs, the age of journals requested,
the types and ages of materials requested by the various types of libraries
(university, pharmaceutical, etc.).  The tables are arranged to give evidence
of the types of frequency distribution revealed by the Survey, as well as to
indicate central tendency, dispersion, rank order, and possibly correlations
for significant factors.

An Introduction to Computers in Information Science
.A
Artandi, S.
.W
        This book is an introduction to the field of information science
and technology, with particular emphasis on document organization.
Its point of view is general in the sense that it attempts to deal with
types of problems rather than particular systems.  When particular
systems are described they are used as examples of systems rather
than as models.
        The method of presentation is expository at the introductory
level.  While differing points of view are frequently noted, this book
is not intended to provide definitive critical evaluation.  Relevant
research is reviewed in order to indicate current thinking and activities
in the field.

Introduction to Information Science
.A
Saracevic, T.
.W
  The main emphasis of this book is on work of a theoretical
and experimental nature rather than on practical
applications.  However, the articles selected are viewed
as having a considerable potential in two major respects:
they have important implications for the practice of
information handling, but even more important, they contain
aspects of generalization.  The book is oriented
toward basic and experimental work, such as that
performed by traditional sciences, with the hope that a
reader may find much relevant to his own interests,
educational level and background, a bridge toward
generalizations, a feeling of interconnection between
seemingly unrelated works either presented in the book or
found in the literature, an awareness of apparent gaps in
knowledge, and even ideas for practical solutions or
further theoretical or experimental work.

Introduction to Library Science:
Basic Elements of Library Service
.A
Shera,J.H.
.W
    Librarianship classifies as a social science because the library, as an
institution, is a creature of society, and its goal is the improvement of
society by helping the individual to understand himself and the world of
which he is a part.  But the library is also concerned with man as a 
rational being.  Thus, it remains primarily a humanistic enterprise.  The
traditional lines of demarcation among the disciplines are breaking down
and in certain areas becoming almost obliterated; and librarianship, in
both its technology and its services, is drawing ever closer to the social
and physical sciences.  But we would do well to remind ourselves of the 
library's humanistic origins; otherwise, in excessive enthusiasm for the
technology of science and the social action of the behaviorist, we may lose
sight of the individual and his needs and the humanistic values implicit
in them.

Introduction to Subject Indexing; a Programmed Text
.A
Brown, A.G.
.W
  This programmed text has been developed from work initially carried out
under a research project funded by the Office for Scientific and Technical
Information (now the British Library Research and Development
Department).  The project, designed to investigate the applicability of the
techniques of programmed instruction in the teaching of practical subject
indexing, was conducted at the School of Librarianship, the Polytechnic
of North London in cooperation with the College of Librarianship Wales.
The programmed instruction course, written during this project and used
by students at both Schools of Librarianship, forms the basis of the
programmed text.
  Most of the existing programmed texts relevant to the field of practical
subject indexing are concerned with the translation stage of indexing and
aim to impart skills in the use of particular indexing languages.  Our
intention, in the above-mentioned project, was to produce a course of
programmed instruction which presented an integrated view of the basic
principles and practices of subject indexing rather than attempting to 
impart to the student a high degree of familiarity with any particular
system.

Introduction to Systems Philosophy
.A
Laszlo, E.
.W
    The general systems theory, pioneered by von Bertalanffy,
Kenneth Boulding, Anatol Rapoport and their collaborators, gives us a
theoretical instrument for assuring the mutual relevance of scientific
information and philosophic meaning.  Extended into a general systems
philosophy, this instrument can polarize the contemporary theoretical scene
as a magnet polarizes a field of charged particles: by ordering the formerly
random segments into a meaningful pattern.  If made good use of, this
instrument could channel to us a stream of informed as well as sophisticated
answers through the cross-fertilization of contemporary science and
philosophy.
    This, then is my credo; the conviction which led to the formulation of the
present Introduction to "systems philosophy" over a period of three years
of research in alternating states of euphoria and dejection.

Introduction to Theoretical Linguistics
.A
Lyons, J.
.W
  This is a introductory book in the sense that it does not presuppose
any previous training in the subject.  But it does assume that
the reader - especially the reader whose educational background, like
my own, is more in the 'humanities' than in mathematics and
'science' - is prepared to make a certain intellectual effort with respect
to the use of symbols and formulae.  Few subjects suffer more than
linguistics from the separation of the 'sciences' and the 'humanities'
that is still maintained in the curricula of most of our schools ad
universities.  For contemporary linguistic theory draws simultaneously,
and in roughly equal measure, upon the more traditional approach
to language that is characteristic of the 'humanities' and the more
'scientific' approach that has developed recently in connection with
advances that have been made in formal logic, computer science and
automata theory.

Introduction to University Library Administration
.A
Thompson, J.
.W
   The last ten years have witnessed the growth of
an intense public interest in university affairs.  Almost anything
to do with universities is now headline news.  Previously such attention
as they did receive was limited to brief reports in sober middle class
newspapers of appointments, awards and meetings, leavened once a
year by an obligatory account in all newspapers of the Boat Race.
All this has changed: as Michael Befoff comments in his book The
Plateglass Universities (having made the foregoing points and more
besides), what were once ivory towers have now become goldfish
bowls.
   He goes on to give the obvious explanation for the change: 
universities are of public interest because they are now almost wholly
supported by the taxpayers' money.  They represent a massive investment
on the part of the government, and consequently are expected to
yield a vitally important return in trained and educated manpower.
Over the last twenty years government expenditure in this country
on universities has risen from four million pounds a year to more
than two hundred million pounds a year.  The total university student
population is in excess of two hundred thousand, and teaching and
research staff number approximately twenty-five thousand.

Indivisible Colleges; Diffusion of Knowledge in Scientific Communities
.A
Crane, D.
.W
  In the last two decades, dramatic increases in the
scope and volume of scientific research have occurred, as
may be illustrated by the fact that the amount of scientific
literature is doubling approximately every ten years (Price
1963).  For the scientist who needs to locate particular items
of scientific information and for the documentation specialist
who must make them readily available, the organization and
management of this huge and expanding store of information
is a serious problem.  Increasingly radical solutions are being
proposed.  For example, some experts would like to scrap
scientific journals and distribute their contents piecemeal.
Information retrieval and delivery systems are being developed
to enable scientists to locate information quickly and effectively.

A Dynamic Programming Approach to R and D Budgeting and Project Selection
.A
Hess, Sidney W.
.W
   Contemporary models of research and development are incomplete in that they
ignore the many reappraisals and budgeting decisions that occur in the time
between a project's proposal and its commercialization.. The sequential 
decision aspects of project budgeting are particularly important since 1) the
research expenditure is usually an order of magnitude less than the irrevocable
investment for commercialization and 2) an allocation to a project today does 
not presuppose continuation of the project into future periods..
   The research and development budgeting problem is structured to take into 
account the sequential decision characteristic.. Utilizing the technique of
dynamic programming, methods are developed to determine optimal project budgets
when the aggregate research and development budget is either constrained or
unconstrained.. These models also suggest a rational explanation of the 
patterns of project expenditures over time that one observes in practice..
   Finally, some of the shortcomings of the developed methods which inhibit
their practical application are discussed..

The Association Factor in Information Retrieval
.A
Stiles, H. Edmund
.W
   This paper describes an all computer document retrieval system which can find
documents related to a request even though they may not be indexed by the exact
terms of the request, and can present these documents in the order of their
relevance to the request.. The key to this ability lies in the application of a
statistical formula by which the computer calculates the degree of association 
between pairs of index terms.. With proper manipulation of these associations 
(entirely within the machine) a vocabulary of synonyms, near synonyms and other
words closely related to any given term or group of terms is derived.. Such a
vocabulary related to a group of request terms is believed to be a much more
powerful tool for selecting documents from a collection than has been available
heretofore.. By noting the number of matching terms between this extended list 
of request terms and the terms used to index a document, and with due regard 
for their degree of association, documents are selected by the computer and 
arranged in the order of their relevance to the request..

A Study of Methods for Systematically Abbreviating English Words and Names
.A
Bourne, Charles P.
.A
Ford, Donald F.
.W
   This study investigated various techniques for systematically abbreviating 
English words and names.. Most of the attention was given to the techniques 
which could be mechanized with a digital device such as a general purpose 
digital computer.. Particular was paid to techniques that could process 
incoming  information without prior knowledge of its existence (i.e., no table
lookups).. Thirteen basic techniques and their modifications are described..
In addition, most of the techniques were tested on a sample of several thousand
subject words and several thousand proper names in order to provide a 
quantitative measure of comparison..

Automatic Document Classification
.A
Borko, Harold
.A
Bernick, Myrna
.W
   Starting with a collection of 405 document abstracts dealing with
computers, the experiment in automatic document classification proceeds
to construct an
empirically based, mathematically derived classification system by use of a
factor analysis technique.. The documents are then classified into these 
derived categories by five subjects, and the resulting classification serves
as a criterion against which the automatic classification is to be evaluated..
Of the 90 documents in the validation group which contained two or more clue
words, and which therefore could be automatically classified, 44 documents, or
48.9 per cent, were placed into their correct categories by use of a computer 
formula.. These results are almost identical to the results obtained by Maron
in a previous experiment using the same data but with a different set of 
classification categories and a different computational formula.. The 
experimental evidence support the conclusion that automatic document 
classification is possible.. Additional experiments are described which when 
executed should improve the accuracy of the automatic classification 
technique..

Semantic Clustering of Index Terms
.A
Gotlieb, C. C.
.A
Kumar, S.
.W
   A computer procedure to recognize indexing vocabularies is described..Index
terms are drawn from the vocabulary of a structured indexing system and may
consist of single words, collection of words, or syntactic phrases.. The basic
idea is that a measure of the semantic association between index terms can be 
determined from the structural relationships which the terms exhibit by their
relative positions in the system.. The association measure, which is based on a 
priori (preassigned) semantic relationships between terms, rather than their 
co-occurrence in a document corpus, is then for grouping index terms into 
clusters or concepts.. Some results of an experimental investigation are 
presented..
   Information, retrieval, clustering, index terms, semantic, graphs, clusters,
associations, synonyms, subgraphs, complete, maximal, connected, component,
relevance measure, vocabulary, indexing systems, cliques..

   Memory utilization and retrieval time from direct access inverted files
are investigated as a function of the data base, the demands on it, and a 
parameter which the system designer may control.. An analysis of the effects
of data base characteristics and data base usage is also made for a linked

The Application of Pattern Recognition to Screening Prospective
Anticancer Drugs
.A
Kowalski, B.R.
.W
  Pattern recognition has been introduced to the
chemical literature as a general tool which can be used
by the chemist to reduce masses of experimental data to
relevant information.  Perhaps more importantly, it
provides connections between raw, multivariant data
and sought-for information without making restrictive
assumptions about the underlying statistics of the data.
The general problem has been stated as follows.  Given
a collection of objects and a list of measurements made
on each object, is it possible to find and/or predict a
property of the objects that is not directly measurable
but is known to be related to the measurements via
some unknown relationship?  The only assumption
made is that similarities and dissimilarities among
objects are reflected in at least some of the
measurements.

Stereochemically Unique Naming Algorithm
.A
Wipke, W. Todd
Dyott, Thomas M.
.W
   An algorithm has been developed and implemented to generate for each 
chemical structure a unique and invariant linear name which includes double 
bond and asymmetric carbon isomerism.. A logical proof is given for the 
one-to-one correspondence between name and structure.. By inspection of the
linear names of two structures, one can determine if the two structures are
identical, nonisometric, constitutionally isometric, diastereometric, or
enantiometric.. The algorithm determines the true stereocenters and calculates
a reduced set of chiral centers, Src.. It is proven that if three are any 
centers in Src that the compound must be chiral; an a chiral compound must have 
Src = null.. Extensions of the algorithm are outlined to allow uniquely naming 
conformational isomers..

Deriving Term Relations for a Corpus by Graph Theoretical Clusters
.A
Augustson, J.G.
Minker, J.
.W
  We discuss how alternative methods of automatic
term clustering may provide insight into how terms are
related within a corpus.  The work reported uses a
corpus of 2267 documents that contain 3950 index
terms.	A similarity matrix is developed using the
document - term matrix.  A threshold level T is applied to
the similarity matrix.  Entries in the matrix that are
greater than or equal to the threshold level are set
equal to one, and the remaining entries are set to zero.
  Three definitions are applied to the corresponding
graph of each threshold matrix to develop clusters.
These are, (1) the connected components of the graph,
(2) the maximal complete subgraphs of the graph, and
(3) the combined maximal complete subgraphs of the
graph as described that show how insight may be
gained into the term relations by varying the threshold
levels and the cluster definitions.

Automatic Abstracting and Indexing..
II. Production of Indicative Abstracts by Application of Contextual 
Inference and Syntactic Coherence Criteria
.A
Rush, J. E.
Salvador, R.
Zamora, A.
.W
   Together with the increasing shortage of qualified abstracts, the factors 
of time, cost and value have lent impetus to a trend toward the automatic 
generation of abstracts and indexes.. This trend has caused increased emphasis
to be placed on the abstract as the locus of data for automatic retrieval
systems.. This necessitates the creating of high quality abstracts.. It is the
purpose of this paper to report on the development of techniques for the 
automatic production of high quality abstracts from the full text of the 
original document.. It is necessary to analyze the conditions under which 
various methods of sentence selection are successful, in order to develop 
criteria for selecting sentences to form an abstract.. But clearly, an abstract 
can be produced by rejecting sentences of the original which are irrelevant to 
the abstract.. As will be seen, it is this point which is perhaps the most
significant contribution of this paper.. Methods of sentence selection and
rejection are discussed.. These include contextual inference, intersentence
reference, frequency criteria, and coherency considerations.. The automatic
abstracting system we have developed consists basically of a dictionary, called 
the Word Control List, and of a set of rules for implementing certain functions
specified for each WCL entry.. The abstracts we have obtained so far are of
sufficiently good quality to indicate that large-scale testing of the methods
of the automatic abstracting system is warranted..

Linguistics and Information Science
.A
Montgomery, C.A.
.W
  This paper defines the relationship between linguistics
and information science in terms of a common interest
in natural language.  The notion of automated processing
of natural language - i.e., machine simulation of
the language processing activities of a human - provides
novel possibilities for interaction between linguists,
who have a theoretical interest in such activities,
and information scientists, who have more practical
goals, e.g. simulating the language processing activities
of an indexer with a machine.
  The concept of a natural language information system
is introduced as a framework for reviewing automated
language processing effort by computational
linguists and information scientists.  In terms of this
framework, the former have concentrated on automating
the operations of the component for content analysis
and representation, while the latter have emphasized
the data management component.  The complementary
nature of these developments allows the
postulation of an integrated approach to automated
language processing.  This approach, which is outlined
in the final sections of the paper, incorporates current
notions in linguistic theory and information science, as
well as design features of recent computational linguistic
models.

   A combination of quantitative and qualitative analyses were used on the
journal articles indexed in one volume of Library Literature.. Findings
include: the dispersion of a articles among journals followed a Bradford-type
distribution except for a "collapse" at the end, possibly showing low level of
interaction of librarianship with other fields; considerable proportion of
articles was of news-type; administration was the largest single subject 
covered.. The methodology may be appropriate for analysis of activities in 
other fields..

A Decision Theory View of the Information Retrieval Situation:
An Operations Research Approach
.A
Kraft, Donald H.
.W
   A decision theory approach is used to model the information retrieval 
decision problem of which documents to retrieve from a library collection in 
response to a specific user query for information.. A thorough discussion of
decision theory, including the components of the alternatives,states-of-nature,
outcomes, and evaluations - as well as of the optimization process under the 
cases of certainty, risk, and uncertainty - is presented.. Bayesian statistics
are also discussed to show how prior information about the various documents 
via classification analysis can affect the decision process under risk.. An 
example problem is used to illustrate the decision theory approach and to
compare tha overall performance of the retrieval system under risk with and
without document classification information..
   Thus, the operations research technique of decision theory is used to model
the retrieval decision process, illustrate how important evaluation is, and to
demonstrate the value of prior information via document classification 
analysis.. Moreover, the paper presents, in a somewhat tutorial mode, an
overall framework for considering the information retrieval decision problem,
incorporating the aspects of cost-effectiveness and alternative evaluation,
which allows one to better understand the contributions made by many 
researchers in this crucial area..

   A study was undertaken to classify mechanically a document collection using 
the free-language words in the titles and abstracts of a corpus of 261 physics

closely duplicated the clusters obtained by previous experiments with 
citations.. A brief comparison is made with a traditional manual classification
system.. It is shown that the mechanical procedure is capable of achieving 
simultaneous average relevance and recall figures above 80%..

Probabilistic Models for Automatic Indexing
.A
Bookstein, A.
Swanson, D.R.
.W
  This paper is developed in two stages.  The first
stage describes an experiment that explores properties
of the class of words that are not useful in conveying
subject meaning and distinguishes them from those
classes of words that do convey subject meaning to
various degrees.  In particular, we study the clustering
properties of these words; the analysis is based on
statistical properties alone, and techniques are
introduced that may be of value in other areas of
information science.  On the basis of the results of this
experiment, a model of word occurrences is introduced and
discussed.  Later papers by us and by Harter will apply
this model to indexing.

Functions of a Man-Machine Interactive Information Retrieval System
.A
Williams, J. H. Jr.
.W
   An effective man-machine interactive retrieval system is not achieved by
simply placing a terminal on each end of an existing machine retrieval system..
An interactive system requires a sequence of steps in which man and machine
alternately take action.. It should also provide different levels of services
to experienced and inexperienced searchers, recognize the difference between a
narrow and broad query, furnish clues as to the next direction to be searched, 
recognize the data base dynamically as the searcher changes his viewpoint, 
provide a ranking of responses in the most likely sequence and offer the 
searcher the option of overriding the ranking when a particular term is of 
extreme significance..
   An online interactive system meeting many of these needs has been developed
and tested.. The objectives of the development of this system, BROWSER, was to
investigate the effectiveness of a free-form query with a combinatorial search
algorithm and the effectiveness of various techniques and components to 
facilitate online browsing..

Overlap in the Lists of Journals Monitored by Biosis, CAS, and Ei
.A
Wood, James L.
Flanagan, Carolyn
Kennedy, H. E.
.W
   In April 1970, the BioSciences Information Service of Biological Abstracts, 
the Chemical Abstracts Service, and Engineering Index, Inc. began a five-part
study to determine the relationships between and the overlap in coverage in
their printed publications and computer-readable services.. This study was 
designed to provide information needed by these three accessing services for 
planning future cooperative programs and for reconciling differences in policies
and practices so as to make their publications and services more useful to their
user communities..
   This paper is based on the first part of the study, which compared listings 
of the journals each service was routinely monitoring as of 1 May 1970.. Of the
14,592 different journals monitored, 1% were monitored by all three of the
services, 27% were monitored by two of the three services, and 72% were 
monitored by only one of the three services.. Subsequent phases of the study
will determine the extent to which the services cover the same articles within
the journals..

Structure and Effectiveness of The Citation Identifier, an
Operational Computer Program for Automatic Identification of Case
Citations in Legal Literature
.A
Borkowski, Casimir
Cepanec, Louis
Martin, J. Sperling
Salko, Virginia
Treu, Siegfried
.W
   A computer program for automatic identification of "full form" case
citations in legal literature (e.g., Rutherford v. Geddes, 4 Wall. 220,
18 L. Ed. 343; Southland Industries, Inc. v. Federal Communications
Commission, 1938, 69 App. D.C., 82, 99 F.2D 117) has been developed
by this group and is now operational.. 
   The level of performance of this program known as "The Citation
Identifier" is high.. In a recent computer run, The Citation
Identifier scanned ther full texts of 191 randomly selected decisions
of U.S. Court of Appeals (some 400,000 words of running text) and 
located correctly 2,220 full-form citations out of a total of 2,227
(that is, better than 99% of the total).. Only seven misses and three
false drops occurred..
   Of 2,220 full-form citations located correctly, 1944 (87%) were
identified perfectly.. In addition, there were 276 partial identifications
containing two types of errors:  (1) partial identifications in which some
citation terms were mistakenly lopped off by the program ("short hits");
and (2) partial identifications that contained words improperly included
in the citations ("long hits").
   Both types of errors are, for the most part, easily correctible and
can be largely eliminated by suitable changes in the program..
   The Citation Identifier operates rather rapidly.. In a recent test run,
the total time required to process some 400,000 running words of text
was approximately 15 1/2 minutes.. This speed could be further increased
by suitable changes in the computer program..
   An extension of The Citation Identifier to reduced-form citations (e.g.,
"the Geddes decision", "the Southland Industries case") is now in preparation..

Title Indexes as Alerting Services in the Chemical and Life Sciences
.A
Bottle, Robert T.
.W
   The principles underlying alerting services are discussed.. General alerting
services (as distinct from SDI systems) need to transfer to their users a large 
quantity of current but mainly irrelevent information as speedily as possible..
As title indexes are the easiest to prepare and are therefore common, the user 
needs to know how much significant information is not discernible from a 
documents title.. This is estimated to be 20-25% but can vary with subject and
type of information sought.. If a search of, say, Chemical Titles is made,
ignoring synonyms but allowing for all syntactical variants, only about one
third of the significant information will be recovered.. Synonyms and other
nomenclature problems are discussed.. Delay times and time of use are the two 
most important factors in evaluating an alerting service and are reviewed for 
some typical services..

Evaluation of a KWIC Index for Library Literature
.A
Brodie, N.E.
.W
  A librarian attempting to do a literature search currently
faces an eight-month gap in access to the literature of
his field through Library Literature.  In April 1968,
librarians made a rare examination of their own literature
and considered this gap and other information problems
in librarianship.  The Albany Conference on the Bibliographic
Control of Library Science Literature recommended the
establishment of a fast announcement service for library
schools (1).  A monthly Keyword in Context (KWIC) index
serving the whole range of information-oriented professions 
was a specific proposal which was favored by one conference
group to meet the need for current information (2).

The Practice of Charging Users for Information Services: A State of the Art
Report
.A
Penner, Rudolf J.
.W
   The state of the art literature review disclosed that society has not yet
come to the point that paying for library information services is a common 
thing.. It was also found that a sound basis for determining the costs of the
services - let alone charge for them - does not exist: While some data on 
specific cost for unit operations are available, it is very difficult to 
compare the data and arrive at meaningful figures.. Nevertheless, there is an
indication that large operating centers are becoming concerned with cost to the
point that they are cost-according their operations, which would permit them
to establish realistic fees for their services..

Towards a Metascience of Information:  Informatology
.A
Otten, Klaus 
.A
Debons, Anthony
.W
   Arguments are advanced to suggest that information and operations on 
information are phenomena, the principles of which provide the basis for a
metascience of information  (informatology).. The fundamental character of the
phenomena is evidenced in the operations executed during the processing and
communication functions.. The role of the metascience is dictated by several
factors, namely, the need for a common basis upon which all information-
oriented specialized sciences and technologies can be understood and studied,
a common framework and language for all scientists and technologists concerned
in some form or other with information on one side and man's relationship
to the phenomena on the other side..  The content of the postulated metascience
of information is circumscribed by a list of specific questions and problems
for which the science has to provide answers and solutions.. It is suggested
that an educational concept responsive to the needs of metascience of 
information be developed and implemented..

An Evaluation of Index Medicus and MEDLARS in the Field of Ophthalmology
.A
Virgo, Julie A.
.W
   An evaluation of the performance of Index Medicus and MEDLARS in the field
of ophthalmology is presented, using data generated by a separate study..
MEDLARS performance figures gave a screened precision ratio of 54% and a recall
ratio of 42%.. Over the same set of questions Index Medicus had a screened 
precision ratio of 53% and a recall ratio of 46%.. Results for Index Medicus 
alone over a large set of questions gave a 73% screened precision ratio and a 
47% recall ratio.. A random sample of MEDLARS and Index Medicus precision and 
recall failures showed that most of the Index Medicus recall failures resulted
from manual searcher omission.. The major causes of Medlars precision failures 
were inadequate indexing terminalogy to express concepts and attempts at
providing too exhaustive a search..

Obsolescence of Special Library Periodicals: Sampling Errors and
Utility Contours
.A
Brookes, B. C.
.W
   Problems arising in the measurement of the rates of obsolescence of the sets
of periodicals taken by special libraries are discussed.. The relatively large
errors that arise in sampling the negative exponential distribution are 
analyzed because they may account for some of the discrepancies reported and
because they indicate the need for firmer statistical control of work on
obsolescence than has yet been generally appreciated..
   When the rate of decline has been satisfactorily established there still
remains the problem of deciding how to apply it.. Issues of those periodicals
that contribute most productively should be retained for a longer period than
those of periodicals that contribute less.. To solve this problem the concept
of "utility contours" is introduced and exemplified in the design of a p%
library..
   It is argued that no discarding policy is likely to be generally applicable; 
every special library must be regarded as a special case.  Rather than suggest
new measurements, therefore, the paper offers simple graphical techniques that
are applicable to any other special case..

These 78 emanate from 24 countries, with about one-half of the specialty
journals being published by 28 national and international societies.. The
second group of journals is composed of those journals used by grantees of
the National Heart Institute (NHI) to publish their findings..
   In fiscal 1967, 5,860 papers, appearing in 789 journals, were reported
to NHI.. Taking the grantees of NHI as being representative of U.S.
c-v researchers, it was found that the specialty journals were not the
most quantitatively fertile sources of c-v information - only about 14%
of American c-v papers were published there.. The remaining 86% of the
literature was widely dispersed throughout 766 nonspecialty c-v 
journals..
   The extent of bibliographic control by the major indexing and
abstracting services was found to be more extensive for the top-ranking
journals in the NHI sample than for the group of c-v specialty journals..

Are Titles of Chemical Papers Becoming More Informative?
.A
Tocatlian, Jacques J.
.W
   The efficiency of key-work-in-context (KWIC) permuted-title indexes and
their numerous variations is highly dependent upon authors' choices of titles
for their papers.. Titles are important not only in commercial services,
such as Chemical Titles, BASIC, Current Contents, and CA Condensates, but
also in scanning primary journals, and in traditional library services, such
as bibliographies.. It is generally believed and often stated that titles
of chemical papers are becoming more informative as authors become
increasingly aware of the importance of titles as "carriers" of information..
The present study was undertaken to test whether (1) titles of chemical papers
are becoming more informative and (2) whether uninformative titles of chemical
papers are being eliminated since the advent of the KWIC index in 1958..
   The first hypothesis was tested by comparing titles published in 1948, 
1958, and 1968 by the following criteria: (1) a count of substantive words
in the title; (2) a count of all word matches between title and 10 leading
substantive words selected from the abstract, with and without the use of a
thesaurus; and (3) a count of word matches between title and 10 leading
substantive words selected from the abstract, with and without the use of
a thesaurus.. The second hypothesis was tested by comparing a count of
short titles (with 3 or less substantive words) published in 1948, 1958,
and 1968..
   Results confirm that uninformative titles of chemical papers are
being eliminated and that informative titles are becoming more informative
since the advent of the KWIC index..

Toward a Theory of Indexing--II
.A
Landry, Bertrand C.
.A
Rush, James E.
.W
   The purpose of this paper is to present the elements of a basis for a
theory of information storage and retrieval.. It is believed that this theory
can best be formulated in terms of a general theory of indexing.. After stating
basic premises and defining essential concepts, the relationship between a 
theory of indexing and a theory of information storage and retrieval is 
considered.. The similarities between the indexing process and the general
communication process are discussed, and indexing is viewed as an order 
increasing (i.e., entropy decreasing) operation.. The concept of a theoretical
index is developed and contrasted with real-world indexing systems.. The
relationship between query formulation, retrieval, and benefit is discussed, 
and these notions are then related to the human performance variable.  It is 
believed that the ideas presented in this paper provide a useful framework 
for more detailed investigations into the indexing process..

The Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Information Retrieval
and Dissemination Systems
.A
Lancaster, F.W.
.W
A distinction is made between cost-effectiveness analysis and cost-benefits
analysis as applied to information systems; and the relationship between costs,
performance, and benefits is discussed.. Some factors influencing the
cost-effectiveness of retrieval and dissemination systems are identified..
Various aspects of system operation that are susceptible to cost-effectiveness
analysis are discussed, including system coverage, indexing policies and
procedures, system vocabulary, searching procedures, and mode of interaction
between system and user.. Possible tradeoffs between input and output costs,
and the effects of these tradeoffs on cost-effectiveness are presented.

Some Remarks on Elitism in Information and the
Invisible College Phenomenon in Science
.A
De Solla Price, D.J.
.W
  Let me remind you of that famous place in Dickins'
Pickwick Papers where we hear of a researcher who
composed a copious review on Chinese Metaphysics with
the aid only of the Encyclopedia Britannica, which
contained absolutely no information on that subject.
The technique used, we are told with a nudge of
superiority, was to read for metaphysics under the
letter M, and for China under the letter C, and to
combine the information.
  I feel that we may be performing just such a miracle
of creative juxtaposition when we assume that Scientific
Information is just some special variety of information
that contains queer words like Potassium Permanganate,
pi r squared, and numbers like 2.71828.  We suppose too
that Scientific Libraries are just libraries that happen to be
full of scientific books, and that the best possible
technical librarian would be somebody who had picked up a
library qualification and combined it with the appropriate
sort of technical qualification.  There is, as they used to
say, no mixture of ingredients but a genuine chemical
compound.  I wish to point out two simple facts:  there is
more to scholarship than the mere cumulation, storage 
and retrieval of information, and there is about science
and technology something intrinsically different from
mere scholarship.

Human Factors in the Design of an Interactive Library System
.A
McAllister, Caryl
Bell, John M.
.W
   ELMS (Experimental Library Management System) is an experimental
system for total library management, operating on-line with an IBM 360
through IBM 2260 and 2741 terminals.. The system is designed to handle
large amounts of highly variable information which it processes on 
command, giving on-line computer service for all library operations..
At the same time, it must accommodate the different needs and skills
of a broad range of library users, from new patrons to well-trained
librarians..
   Such a system presents programming problems that will be typical
of large, interactive computer systems in the seventies.. This paper
discusses ELMS features that facilitate user interaction, and may prove
useful in similar systems:  techniques for tutoring the user (display
format, one-question, one-answer displays, and KWIC indexing); adaptability
for the experienced user (command chains and a standard set of four-letter
mnemonic codes for higher-level control); minimization of keying (line
numbers, one-character mnemonic codes used with procedures, and use of
default conditions); performance of clerical tasks by exception notification;
and collection of operational statistics to help improve the system..

On-Line Systems: Promise and Pitfalls

increasingly important, both for information retrieval and library support
operations.. The virtues of these systems are speed, intimacy, and -
if time-sharing is involved - economy.. The major problems are the cost of
the large computers and files necessary for bibliographic data, the still-
high cost of communications, and the generally poor design of the user-
system interfaces.. The desirable features of on-line retrieval interfaces
are only now being defined and tested in a systematic way, e.g., by the
National Library of Medicine in its AIM-TWX nationwide experimental
retrieval service.. System implementers must, in addition to engineering
the right capabilities into on-line systems, also make a careful, 
concerted effort to engineer user acceptance.. Common pitfalls here
include overselling system capabilities and failure to take into account
the social context around the user terminal.. The major national problem
is to avoid or limit wasteful and expensive duplication in providing
nationwide search access to the hundreds of public and private data
bases that will be readily available during the next few years.. We do
not need technological breakthroughs to exploit the potential of
on-line systems, but we do need breakthroughs in organizing for
technological change..

Selected Results From An Inquiry Into Testing of
Information Retrieval Systems 
.A
Saracevic, Tefko
.W
   A variety of aspects related to testing of retrieval systems were
examined.. A model of a retrieval system, together with a set of measures
and a methodology for performance testing were developed.. In the main
experiment the effect on performance of the following variables
was tested:  sources of indexing, indexing languages, coding schemes,
question analyses, search strategies and formats of output.. In
addition, a series of separate experiments was carried out to investigate
the problems of controls in experimentation with IR systems.. The main
conclusions:  the human factor appears to be the main variable in all
components of an IR system; length of indexes affects performance
considerably more than indexing languages; question analyses and search
strategies to affect performance to a great extent - as much, if not  more
than indexing.. Retrieval systems seem to be able to perform at present only
on a general level, failing to be at the same time comprehensive and specific..
It seems that testing of total IR systems controlling and monitoring all
factors (environmental and systems-related) is not possible at present..

What Makes An Automatic Keyword Classification Effective?
.A
Jones, K. Sparck
.A
Barber, E. O.
.W
   Though the idea of constructing a keyword classification for retrieval
purposes automatically is not a new one, comparatively few systematic
experiments have been carried out in this area; and while many suggestions
have been put forward, not enough is known about the behaviour of automatic
keyword classifications, and hence about the properties such classifications
should have and the ways they should be used.. In previous experiments we
showed that some forms of classification could give good results, and this
paper describes a further series of tests designed to examine this sort of
classification in more detail, with a view to establishing the optimum forms
of classification and procedures for using them in different retrieval 
situations.. These tests demonstrate that further improvements in 
performance over that for unclassified keywords can be obtained, and that
definite conclusions can be drawn about the correct approach to classification
for collections like the test one: the best results are given when grouping
is confined to strongly connected, nonfrequent keywords, when the 
classification is used to provide additional rather than alternative indexing
terms, particularly for requests, and when matching is controlled by keyword
frequency..

Machine-Assisted Approach to General Reference Materials
.A
Meredith, J. C.
.W
   A collection of 144 general reference works was analyzed and encoded
according to 254 identifiable characteristics of services and contained data,
comprising an "approach language" expressing search parametrs.. In response to
a request submitted at on-line terminal, the "REFSEARCH" system retrieves the
names of those works who profiles meet or exceed the specification.. The 
background and rationale of the system is discussed, its current use in the 
School of Librarianship, University of California, and its potential for direct 
service to library patrons..

Curricula in Information Science:  Analysis and Development
.A
Belzer, J
Isaac, A
Finkelstein, E.
Williams, J.
.W
  The Curriculum Committee of the Special Interest
Group/Education Information Science of ASIS is
charged with the responsibility for determining the
scope and characteristics of information science
programs in the US and Canada in terms of Curriculum
developments and course offerings.  To fulfill this 
responsibility, questionnaires were developed to elicit
reliable information concerning courses being offered relating
to information storage and retrieval, information
science and/or documentation.  The data requested
included course levels, pre- and post-requisite courses,
textbooks used, topics covered, frequency with which
offered, etc.
  Responses were received from 45 schools, providing
information about 185 courses and 242 topics.  Using
several methods of clustering the data, it was difficult
to arrive at firm results, because of the diversity and
scatter of the topics included in this field.  It was
therefore decided to hold a workshop of experts which
would examine the validity of the questionnaire results.
  This workshop, using the Delphi technique to arrive
at consensus, was held at the University of Pittsburgh
on September 21-23, 1970.  Sixteen specialists in the
field representing universities industry and government
were brought together to participate.  Consensus was
reached in identifying nine factors which contribute to
the curriculum in information science and seven courses
which constitute the core for the Master's program.
The topics to be included in each of these courses were
also isolated.

On the Evaluation of Information Science
.A
Harmon, Glynn
.W
   The emergence and development of information science within its wider 
disciplinary framework is interpreted.. Information science is approached as
one of a modern generation of communication or behavioral disciplines which
emerged almost simultaneously around World War II.. Consequently, an attempt is
made to discern the evolution of relationship between information science and
other generation disciplines.. The internal development of information science
is first sketched.. Second, possible relationship and roles of information 
science within a potentially emergent suprasystem of knowledge are discussed..

Compound Words: A Problem in Post-Coordinate Retrieval Systems
.A
Jones, Kevin P.
.W
   Compound words cause some difficulty in post-coordinate indexing
systems:  if too many are fractured, or the wrong categories are selected
for fracturing, noise will be produced at unacceptable levels on retrieval..
Various prior suggestions for handling compound terms are examined which
include those for pre-coordinated or rotated, indexes..
   The syntactic origins are also explored and it is found that many
compound words hinge on a prepositional relationship between the components,
and that this relationship can be applied to decision making.. Other
compound words are in effect abbreviated statements from longer phrases, 
while some are influenced by the presence of a verb-like form..
   These syntactic influences, together with some of the philosophy from
earlier studies - especially that of the 'force' required to fracture a
term, have been combined to produce a set of rules which have been
employed at the National Rubber Producers' Research Association (NRPRA)
for over two years.. These have greatly eased decision making and have
enabled the thesaural vocabulary to be made more consistent..
   It is also suggested that the rules have some bearing on the
application of roles especially if these are employed on a pre-coordinate
basis..

Some Implications of Automatic Recognition of Bibliographic Elements
.A
Shoffner, Ralph M.
.W
   A theoretical approach to the problem of converting printed bibliographic 
records to machine readable form is developed based on principles of system 
analysis.. Experience from several recent projects conducted by the Institute of
Library Research, University of California, are used to illustrate how this
theoretical approach is currently being tested prior to implementation in a 
large scale conversion project..

Informal Communication Among Scientists in Sleep Research
.A
Crawford, Susan
.W
   At the frontiers of an active area of science, social structure based upon 
communication is demonstrated.. Using sociometric techniques, an informal
communication network was identified which included 73% of the scientists..
Within the network was a core group of scientists who were the focus of a
disproportionately large number of contacts and who were differentiated from
others by greater productivity, higher citation record and wider readership..
Information transferred to these scientists is so situated that it could be
transmitted to 95% of the network scientists through one intermediary scientist
or less..

The Efficiency of MEDLARS Titles for Retrieval
.A
Miller, William L.
.W
   Previous research has indicated that the titles rather than index terms 
would, in the standard MEDLARS system, gave lower Recall but higher Precision..
A title searching technique is described which allows the number of references
retrieved to be fixed before a search commences.. With this technique the
greater applicability of title-terms offsets their relative paucity.. The
title-searching technique is tested using queries put to MEDLARS.. These 
queries were not specially solicited for the test.. Title searching is compared
with the standard MEDLARS index term search and with an index term search with 
fixed output size.. For equal output sizes, Title searching retrieves 4 
relevant references for every 5 retrieved by index term searching.. Thus the 
relative retrieval efficiency of Title and Index terms is so close that the 
choice of one method or the other must be primarily on economic grounds..

   This paper presents a detailed analysis of the content and format of seven
machine-readable bibliographic data bases: Chemical Abstract Service 
Condensates, Chemical and Biological Activities, and Polymer Science and
Technology, Biosciences Information Service's BA Previews including Biological
Abstracts and BioReseach Index, Institute for Science Information Source Tape, 
and Engineering Index COMPENDEX..
   Selected issue test tapes of each data base were printed and checked for the
types of data that were contained in the issue and the methods in which the 
data were formatted.. This paper compared the physical formats of the tapes and
describes the varied treatments given to such data elements as authors, titles, 
abstracts, etc.. Comparison of data bases requires common use of terms.. All
terms are defined at the beginning of the paper..
   The authors found great discrepancies in the presentation of essentially 
similar bibliographic data, and they offer some suggestions for mitigating the 
discrepancies by use of standards..

   A mathematical model is presented which explains the observed exponential 
growth rates of citations and references in a scientific discipline.. The 
independent variables are the growth rate of the number of articles published 
and the decay rate of citation of old literature.. It is shown how the 
parameters of the model can be estimated..

Interface Design for An Interactive Information Retrieval System:
A Literature Survey and a Research System Description
.A
Thompson, David A., Ph.D.
.W
   This article focuses on the human interaction characteristics of an
information retrieval system, suggests some design considerations to
improve man-machine cooperation, and describes a research system at 
Stanford that is exploring some of these techniques..
   Librarians can only be of limited assistance in helping the naive
user formulate an unstructured feeling in his mind into an appropriate
search query that maps into the retrieval system.. Consequently, the
process of query formulation by the user, interactively with the
information available in te system, remains one of the principal
problems in information retrieval today..
   In an attempt to solve this problem by improving the interface
communication between man and the computer, we have pursued the
objective of displaying hierarchically structured index trees on a CRT
in a decision tree format permitting the user merely to point (with a
light pen) at alternatives which seem most appropriate to him.. Using
his passive rather than his active vocabulary expands his interaction
vocabulary by at least an order of magnitude.. Moreover, a 
hierarchically displayed index is a modified thesaurus, and may be
augmented by adding lateral links to provide semantic assistance to
the user.. A hierarchical structure was chosen because it seems to
replicate the structure of cognitive thought processes most closely, 
thus allowing the simplest, most direct transfer of the man's problem
into the structure and vocabulary of the system..

Improving a Field-based "Eric-Like" Information System
.A
Paisley, W.
.W
  This is a period for rapid growth in information systems
for the sciences and professions.  Information centers
are springing up across the country.  Federal agencies
and private groups are both collaborating and competing
to establish comprehensive systems.
  Changing the library's name to "information center" is
more than linguistic faddism.  New, active roles subordinate
the library's traditional, passive role as a preserver
and codifier of knowledge.  "Information center"
bears analogy to "economic center" and "transportation
center."  Like these centers, its significance is in
transaction.  The significance of a transportation center
lies in routes to other centers.  The significance of an
information center lies in communication lines to knowledge 
producers and knowledge users.  Information centers are
judged by their information "throughput," not by their 
"holdings."

A new comparison Between Conventional Indexing (MEDLARS) 
and Automatic Text Processing (SMART)
.A
Salton, G.
.W
   A new testing process is described designed to compare conventional retrieval
(MEDLARS) and automatic text analysis methods (SMART).. The results obtained 
with a collection of documents chosen independently of either SMART or MEDLARS
indicate that a simple automatic extraction of keywords from document abstracts
produces a 30 to 40 percent loss compared with MEDLARS indexing.. A replacement
of the unranked Boolean searches used in MEDLARS by the standard ranked output 
normally provided by SMART reduces the loss to between 15 and 20 percent.. When
automatically generated word control list or a thesaurus is used as part of the 
SMART analysis, the results are comparable in effectiveness to those obtained 
by the intellectual MEDLARS indexing.. Finally, the incorporation of user 
feedback procedures into SMART furnishes an improvement over the normal MEDLARS 
output of 15 to 30 percent.. 
   One concludes again that no technical justification exists for maintaining 
controlled, manual indexing in operational retrieval environments..

   A selected sample of U.K. University, industrial and Government scientists
were given a current-awareness service for 18 months, in order to investigate
the practicability and problems of such a service.. Six hundred profiles were 
run, using the natural-language data bases Chemical Titles and 
Chemical-Biological Activities produced by Chemical Abstracts Service..
   Precision and recall were measured, and correlations between profile
performance and such factors as subject area and profile logic were 
investigated statistically.. Precision and recall failures were analyzed and 
various improvements to the system were suggested as a consequence..
   It was concluded that a viable computerized current-awareness service based 
on searching natural language could be created..

The Development of a Semantic Differential to
Assess Users' Attitudes Towards An On-line Interactive
Reference Retrieval System
.A
Katzer, Jeffrey
.W
   A semantic differential (SD) is a commonly used instrument which can
be used to reliably measure attitude toward a variety of objects or
concepts.. Each SD consists of a series of bipolar adjective scales on
which a respondent reacts, in relation to the object or concept of interest..
To interpret completed SDs, it simplifies the procedures and aids in the
development of theory if the adjective scales are grouped into one or more
independent clusters.. The primary purpose of this study was to identify
those clusters (or dimensions) applied by a user of an on-line user-oriented
reference retrieval system when he reacts toward such a system..
   Seventy-one who used or were familiar with a working on-line reference
retrieval system completed a packet of 20 SDs, each consisting of the same
19 adjective scales.. The correlations among the scales were factor 
analyzed.. Three independent dimensions were identified.. Factor I was 
labeled "evaluative-specific" and accounted for over 23% of the total
variance.. Factor II was called "desirability"; it accounted for over 
17% of the total variance.. And, Factor III, entitled "enormity" accounted
for over 10% of the total variance.. Another analysis showed the factor
structure to be highly reliable.. Therefore, if the derived three
dimensional structure underlies users' attitudes toward a more general
class of retrieval systems, then undimensional or unstructured system
evaluation of users' attitudes will be simplistic and possibly misleading..
   In order to construct a working semantic differential, 10 adjective
scales were identified which best represented the three dimensions..
Brief instructions are included which outline how to use this SD..
The discussion is mainly concerned with the obtained factor structure
and the need for a predicative replication of the study..

What Information Dissemination Studies Imply Concerning the Design of
On-Line Reference Retrieval Systems*
.A
Back, Harry B.
.W
   The use of an on-line computer system for locating bibliographic citations
has been hailed as an important innovation for coping with the "information
explosion.." However, on-line reference retrieval is only one element in a
large social system of information dissemination.. To have a widespread impact,
an on-line system must compete successfully with a multitude of other sources
of references.. This paper reviews studies of information dissemination as a
basis for determining how on-line retrieval can best compete.  It recommends
the functional groups for whom an on-line system should be designed and the
forms of written media that should be included in the system's initial data
base.. Finally, it presents criteria the system should satisfy to be as widely
used and as comprehensive as other reference retrieval methods..

   A surprising difference is found in the acceptance of on-line bibliographic 
search between university research workers and students in the classroom.. The
typical research worker, even after careful preparation and individual help, 
abandons the on-line system in favor of more traditional searching techniques..
The student and the seminar participant, on the other hand, take to this new 
tool with enthusiasm and profit.. Bibliographic data bases in physics, 
astronomy and urban systems are available to users through on-line access to 
the Remote Information Query System (RIQS).. Examples of introductory on-line 
sessions are presented and a report of one of the professors participating is 
included..

Citation Patterns fo the Cardiovascular Serial Literature
.A
McMurtray, Frances
.A
Ginski, John M.
.W
   In an attempt to further amplify the characteristics of the cardiovascular
serial literature, citation patterns were studied.. As previously shown, 
one-third of the 5,860 papers from the National Heart Institute grantees for
1967 appeared within 13 journals (3).. After the exclusion of the abstract
journals, the remaining journals were used to obtain a basic pool of 300
cardiovascular related articles.. Science Citation Index was used to
gather statistics relative to citing author, journal and year.. The 300
articles in the basic pool were cited a total of 2,545 times during this
four-year period (1967-1970).. The figures concerning citation rate by
year serve to uphold the idea that journal citation reaches a peak during
the third year after publication.. Also some definite patterns of self-citation
were noted.. It was found that, when analyzed on the basis of first author, 
15 percent of the 2,545 citations were self-citations.. The ten basic 
journals tend to be cited mostly within themselves; one-third of the
citations were found in these journals.. Although the citations were
found throughout 349 journals, indicating an extensive scatter, a
relatively high percentage of papers were found in few journals..

The Use Patterns of Physics Journals in a Large Academic Research Library
.A
Chen, Ching-Chih
.W
   The purpose of this investigation was to reveal the use of patterns of the
physics journals in the M.I.T. Science Library.. The findings are based upon
an analysis of actual use data recorded from all volumes and issues left by
library users on study tables and on trucks in the photocopy area from
March 15 to June 31, 1971.. The Science Library contains some 220 physics
journals.. The study reveals that only 138 journals (62.7%) were used even
once during the 3 1/2-month interval.. A core of 49 journals supplies 90%
of use, and these items would cost 51.1% of the total single subscription
costs of the 138 used titles:  52.3% of use occurs in journal volumes less
than 6 years old.. English is the most used language of physics journals and
the English journals account for 95.3% of use.. American journals, 57.2% of
which are published by the American Institute of Physics, supply 59.4% of the
total use..

A Cost Model for Evaluating Information Retrieval Systems    
.A
Cooper, Michael D.
.W
   This paper develops a mathematical model for use in studying how to 
minimize the cost of operating a mechanized retrieval system.. Through 
the use of cost analysis, the model provides a method for comparative
evaluation between information retrieval systems.. The cost model divides the
costs of a retrieval system into two components:  system costs and user costs..
In addition, it suggests that a trade off exists between the performance
level of the system and the combination of user and systems time that is
expended in working with the system.. This minimizes the total cost of
operating the system.. The allocation is done for a given performance level
and for a given cost per unit of user and system time..

A Bibliometric Analysis of Certain Information Science Literature
.A
Donohue, Joseph C.
.W
   Several bibliometric techniques previously applied to 
separate scientific literatures were used together in the analysis of a
single corpus of journal articles relating to information science.. 
Techniques included are (a) Bradford analysis, (b) epidemic analysis, 
(c) identification of research front, and (d) bibliographic coupling.. 
Similar analysis was made of writings cited by the main corpus articles, 
and of the literature which in turn cites the main corpus.. Results
were analyzed in terms of structure and processes observable in patterns
of authorship, publication, and citation.. Their significance is discussed
with potential application of the method to the solution of problems in the
management of large research libraries..

On-Line  Serials Control System in a Large Biomedical Library;
1) Description of the System
.A
Fayollat, James
.W
   An on-line serials control system with particular emphasis on storage and
maintenance concepts is described.. The system, operational since January,
1971, has evolved from a former batch card system and remains completely
compatible with it.. The system allows real-time display and updating of
all elements of the file.. Consequently all check-in, bindery, and claims
operations, as well as new entries and data field changes are accomplished
on a real-time basis.. All programs are in PL/1.. Required equipment is an
IBM time-shared facility with 100 K memory available for the applications
programs, and IBM 2260 display units..
   This article is the first of three.. The second is concerned with an
analysis of inverted file retrieval features and the third compares the
operation of the on-line with the batch system, comparable manual operations,
and discusses costs..

Interrelationships of Scientific Journals
.A
Narin, Francis
Carpenter, Mark
Berlt, Nancy C.
.W
   A series of models of the interrelationship of scientific journals
has been developed from the cross citing amongst 275 journals in
mathematics, physics, chemistry, biochemistry, and biology..    
The data source was the Journal Citation Index (JCI), a file derived
from the Science Citation Index.. The JCI consists of a journal by
journal tabulation of citings to and from each journal in the index..
A large amount of consistency was found between the citing characteristics
of the journals in the different scientific fields, with quite clear
boundaries between fields and a few well known cross disciplinary
journals as cross field information links..
The separate disciplines appear to relate to each other in an orderly
manner, with a natural sequence:  mathematics --> physics --> chemistry -->
biochemistry --> biology.. Within disciplines the journals form fully
transitive hierarchies with very few relational conflicts..

Managing An Uncontrolled Vocabulary Ex Post Facto
.A
Lefever, Maureen
Freedman, Barbara
Schultz, Louise
.W
   Initiated as an experiment, supported by the Division of Medicinal
Chemistry of Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, the operational
retrospective retrieval service offered by BIOSIS, now in its eighth year, 
exploits a file created essentially without vocabulary control.. The file
comprises some 40 million index access points to 1.87 million references
in research biology announced in Biological Abstracts and BioResearch
Index since September 1959.. A pragmatic program of file building criteria
has been pursued, originally with modest support from the Office of Science
Information Service of the National Science Foundation, which has provided
improved retrieval and an annual summary of the vocabulary of the literature
available to anyone interested (1)..

On-Line Serials Control System on a Large Biomedical Library
Part II. Evaluation of Retrieval Features
.A
Fayollat, James
.W
   The on-line serials control system in use at UCLA Biomedical Library 
utilizes an inverted file for its primary technique.. The correct title is
reached with a entry about 80% of the time by using average of three title 
words.. A detailed profile of title structure and search scheme is given..
The major determinants of the scheme are evaluated on a performance and cost
basis..

Dialectical Inquiring Systems:
A New Methodology for Information Science
.A
Mitroff, Ian I.
Williams, James
Rathswohl, Eugene
.W
   A taxonomy for modeling information systems is presented.. The taxonomy
derives from the history of modern epistemology.. Epistemology is used as a
prescriptive modeling basis because (1) the fundamental problems of 
epistemology are concerned with information, and (2), because the history of
epistemology identifies any archetypal ways that men have conceived of
information and of models..
   It is shown how the different models of epistemology can be made
scientifically operational through the use of a special kind of systems
analysis..
   Finally, the results of a preliminary experiment based on one of the models
are presented in the form of prescriptive rules for the design of future
experiments..

   Of 14,592 primary journals being collectively monitored
by the BioSciences Information Service of Biological Abstracts
(BIOSIS), the Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS), and Engineering Index,
Inc. (Ei) on 1 May 1970, only 4081 were being monitored by two or more
of the services..
   The extent to which all three or any two of these services select
the same journal article for coverage was determined by examining
each service's selection records for the July 1969-June 1970 issues of
these 4081 overlap journals.. The maximum possible journal article
overlap among BIOSIS, CAS and Ei was found to be 822 articles and between
BIOSIS and Ei, 1428 articles.. The journal article overlap between
BIOSIS and CAS was found to be 48,856 articles and between CAS and Ei,
21,583 articles..

Cost Effectiveness of Current Awareness Sources in the Pharmaceutical 
Industry
.A
Ashmole, R. F.
Smith, D. E.
Stern, B. T.
.W
   In a previous paper from The Wellcome Foundation (Scott et al., 1971) a
technique was described for measuring the usefulness of a commercial data base
by comparing the choice of papers and of indexing terms to those chosen as
relevant to the organization.. In this paper we are comparing the cost 
effectiveness of several commercial data bases, journal scanning by information 
scientists, and the impact of private communication..

Clinician Search for Information
.A
Friedlander, Janet
.W
   The use of a medical library by members of the faculty of a medical school
was studied by questionnaire in an effort to ascertain the part the library
played, among channels of communication, in work-related information searches..
The study described the population of users and the kinds of sources
they utilized in an information search, in an effort to identify the factors
influencing their choice of kinds of sources and leading to the possibility of
predicting use of kinds of source once the characteristics of the users were
known.. It brought out a high use of sources which are accessible and easy
to use.. The tabulations show the importance of co-workers in informal
communication.. Low delegation of documentation tasks to libraries was
apparent.. The main user of the library studied was a clinician in the area of
internal medicine who used journal articles about diseases for information to
use in the treatment of his patients.. The recommendations were made that
journals should be shelved accessibly, with Index Medicus nearby.. Books
might be shelved less accessibly.. Telephone access to the library is of
major importance as is the provision of adequate photocopying facilities..

On Selecting a Measure of Retrieval Effectiveness
.A
Cooper, William S.
.W
   It is argued that a user's subjective evaluation of the personal
utility of a retrieval system's output to him, if it could be properly
quantified, would be a near-ideal measure of retrieval effectiveness..
A hypothetical methodology is presented for measuring this utility by
means of an elicitation procedure.. Because the hypothetical methodology
is impractical, compromise methods are outlined and their underlying
simplifying assumptions are discussed.. The more plausible the simplifying
assumptions on which a performance measure is based, the better the measure..
This, along with evidence gleaned from 'validation experiments' of a certain
kind, is suggested as a criterion for selecting or deriving the best measure
of effectiveness to use under given test conditions..

Martin, Thomas H.
Carlisle, James
Treu, Siegfried
.W
   Since little substantiated evidence exists concerning the features that
should of should not be included in the man-machine interface of interactive
bibliographic search and retrieval (IBSR) systems, an informal survey tapping
the opinions of scientists active in this research area was conducted.. An
analysis of the responses showed a significant level of agreement concerning
interface features..

Theoretical Foundations of Thesaurus-Construction and
Some Methodological Considerations for Thesaurus-Updating
.A
Kim, Chai
.W
   It was argued that the present-day thesaurus-construction and maintenance
rules and conventions are not theoretically based.. For this reason, there
are few rules and conventions for updating a thesaurus.. Consequently, 
most of the thesauri adopted by operating information storage and
retrieval systems are not systematically updated.. In order to 
investigate how thesauri are actually updated, a survey was conducted.. 
The working hypothesis was that the communication process between authors
and readers is linear in nature ("one-way" communication allowing no 
reciprocal feedback) if a thesaurus utilized in a system is not updated
by both indexers and question negotiators.. Findings show that thesauri
viewed from the communications point of view do not allow a cybernetic
process of communication ("both-way" communication).. The survey
indicated that the present practice of updating thesauri is largely
done by indexers alone.. No attempt was made to develop a theory of
thesaurus construction and updating.. It was, however, argued that
such a theory, if developed, should at least account for the concepts
of meaning and knowledge.. Within this theoretical framework, two
techniques are suggested to be considered for the systematic updating
of a thesaurus..

The Environment of Classification:
The Concept of Mutual Exclusivity
.A
Jones, Kevin P.
.W
   It has been suggested that information science is still of the stage
of alchemy:  if this is so then mutual exclusivity must form its
philosopher's stone.. Mutual exclusivity appears to be alien to the
observable universe:  that this is so is displayed through a series of
examples.. Some of these relate to everyday things like trees, beaches
and man himself,  whilst others relate to more obscure phenomena like
continental drift and black holes.. The act of observation is also
considered as this has a considerable bearing on the problem..
   Nevertheless, mutual exclusivity must form part of man's mental
powers and this has found expression in the relatively exclusive
series of symbols used in communication.. The dangers of exclusive
thinking in relation to environmental problems are considered, and
this results in a paradox which is probably unresolvable.. Finally, it
is observed that out-standing genius appears to pay scant regard to
existing classifications and is more likely to be involved in an
integrated approach to problems..

   This article deals with the promotion of information services, specifically
the formation and subsequent evaluation of different promotional programs
for selective dissemination of information (SDI) services provided by the
Mechanized Information Center (MIC) at the Ohio State University.. Three
programs -- opinion leadership, "blitz," and telephone solicitation -- 
were developed.. Data were collected to show, for each of the programs:  
(1) the level of market penetration achieved; (2) the level of user
satisfaction generated from the service; (3) the effect in terms of
influence, of the various media employed; and (4) cost effectiveness..
Data analysis focused on a determination of the most effective methods
to promote SDI services..

A Novel Philosophy for the Design of Information Storage
and Retrieval Systems Appropriate for the '70's
.A
Scheffler, Frederic L.
.W
   The philosophy of a systems approach to the design of information
storage and retrieval systems is suggested in which the computer is
recognized in its proper perspective as a powerful and effective
alternative tool.. This philosophy is in contrast to a prevalent
philosophy of the '60's in which many information systems designers
touted the computer as the answer to all information storage and
retrieval situations.. Important principles of information system
design incorporated within the framework of the novel philosophy
for the '70's are presented.. These are:  the performance of users'
needs studies by the representative small group technique; the
analysis of users' needs including their rank ordering by priority; 
the selection and adaptation for a specific application of a suitable
existent information storage and retrieval system from those available; 
the involvement of potential users in the system design by establishing
a model with which they can interact and provide feedback; and the final
design of a cost-effective system.. A number of pitfalls arising from
earlier design methodologies are pointed out, and the avoidance of these
pitfalls by adopting a true systems approach is discussed..

A General Statistical Model for Estimating Future Demand Levels of Data-Base
Utilization Within an Information Retrieval Organization
.A
Ware, Glenn O.
.W
   A statistical model for characterizing the growth patterns of data base
utilization and for estimating future utilization levels of demand has been
developed for information retrieval organizations.. The model developed is
y = b( 1 - e(**-at) ) where y is the number of users of a data base at time t,
and a and b are parameters to be estimated.. Illustrations of the model applied 
to a typical information retrieval organization are given and discussed..

Co-citation in the Scientific Literature: A New Measure of the
Relationship Between Two Documents
.A
Small, Henry
.W
   A new form of document coupling called co-citation is defined as the
frequency with which two documents are cited together.. The co-citation
frequency of two scientific papers can be determined by comparing lists
of citing documents in the Science Citation Index and counting identical 
entries.. Networks of co-cited papers can be generated for specific
scientific specialties, and an example is drawn from the literature
of particle physics.. Co-citation patterns are found to differ 
significantly from bibliographic coupling patterns, but to agree
generally with patterns of direct citation.. Clusters of co-cited
papers provide a new way to study the specialty structure of science..
They may provide a new approach to indexing and to the creation of SDI 
profiles..

Use of an Automatic Text Analyzer in Preparation of SDI Profiles
.A
Carroll, John M.
Tague, Jean M.
.W
   The conventional method of preparing SDI (Selective Dissemination of
Information) profiles often necessitates detailed interview sessions between 
the client and one or more information scientists.. This research shows that by
submitting samples of the client's recent professional reading material to 
automatic text analysis, SDI profiles can be prepared that result in 
significantly higher initial recall scores than do those prepared by 
conventional techniques; relevance scores are not significantly different..
